Is it possible to rent specifically for the 3-month period without penalties? 9. What is the cancellation policy and deposit refund procedure? 10.

Hi Miles Herron, 😊 I hope you're doing well! 🌟 I'm Aashutush from the UCL University Accommodation Portal. I've been trying to get in touch with you regarding the interest you showed in one of the properties, Chapter Kings Cross, London. 🏡 Could you please let me know a good time for us to connect? Looking forward to hearing from you! ✨ Thanks a lot! 😊 Best regards, Ashutush

Aug 17, 03:47 PM
Afternoon Aashutush thanks for reaching out. Apologies for the trouble caused reaching me, by number is the best way I’ve found. Good time for us to connect? By that you mean a call or? Yes I was looking at the Chapter King’s Cross place with term time fast approaching. Would it be possible to view it tomorrow afternoon at some point please? Best, Miles

Aug 17, 03:50 PM
Sorry about the viewings

Aug 17, 03:53 PM
Due to high rush of students the viewings are almost blocked

Aug 17, 03:53 PM
Yah you can do view the property post booking!

Aug 17, 03:53 PM
I see you have filled a booking form

Aug 17, 04:02 PM
Do you want me to process your booking?

Aug 17, 04:02 PM
Do I just need to pay the £25.91, will that hold the room for me to view then?

Aug 17, 04:12 PM
Totally understandable no worries

Aug 17, 04:13 PM
No not 25.91

Aug 17, 04:13 PM
That is a processing fee

Aug 17, 04:13 PM
Since it is peak month for student intake

Aug 17, 04:13 PM
You get a discount for that

Aug 17, 04:13 PM
So you donot need to pay that!

Aug 17, 04:13 PM
So am I able to view the accommodation prior to paying for it completely?

Aug 17, 04:13 PM
Sorry for the questions just thought better to be thorough and 100% sure

Aug 17, 04:14 PM
Okay perfect

Aug 17, 04:14 PM
You will have to pay a holding fee

Aug 17, 04:14 PM
of 185 GBP

Aug 17, 04:14 PM
To get your agreement

Aug 17, 04:14 PM
Would it be possible for me to get back to you later please after I’ve done a bit more research? Completely understand that there’s no promise the place will be available later

Aug 17, 04:15 PM
Okay I understand

Aug 17, 04:15 PM
But it is a really good property

Aug 17, 04:16 PM
There are high chances of the rents to be increasing starting from tomorrow

Aug 17, 04:16 PM
And the availability is also quiet low

Aug 17, 04:19 PM
As King's Cross is quite popular among students!

Aug 17, 04:20 PM

Use these credentials to log in and pay the advance rent of 500 GBP

Aug 17, 07:49 PM
So that we can mark your booking as complete and refund your 25 GBP initial deposit ASAP!

Aug 17, 07:50 PM
Do let me know once done!

Aug 17, 07:53 PM
I was told the deposit for the standard ensuit was 250 GBP - where’s the 500 come from?

Aug 17, 07:54 PM
Yes, it was 250 GBP till a few days back! But post UCAS results were out the properties are facing a huge student intake which is why they increased your advance rent!

Aug 17, 07:55 PM
This will be reduced from your first installment!

Aug 17, 07:56 PM
Could you send me an invoice please to my email address?

Aug 17, 07:58 PM
Ah I see that’s a bit different then understood

Aug 17, 07:58 PM
You will get it once you make the payment directly on the portal

Aug 17, 07:59 PM
Since you are making the payment to the portal not us directly to the property!

Aug 17, 07:59 PM
But do let me know once you complete the payment I will show you how to check your invoice and agreement!

Aug 17, 07:59 PM
And please ensure to do it at the earliest

Aug 17, 08:08 PM
Sounds good mate just bear with me a minute. Will get the money sent over in the next 10. After I secure the room - I would like to view the room tomorrow. I will be in London after lunch

Aug 17, 08:16 PM
Sounds good

Aug 17, 08:27 PM
First lets secure your room!

Aug 17, 08:27 PM
Waiting for your payment!

Aug 17, 08:40 PM
My dad wants to pay the deposit through the UCL.studentacco.com portal. Please can you process my booking through there? He’s waiting to pay now and more than happy to, just more comfortable doing it through a UCL recognisable portal. Cheers

Aug 17, 09:01 PM
That cannot be possible

Aug 17, 09:05 PM
We just take the processing payment

Aug 17, 09:05 PM
Rest as for the rent and everything you pay directly to the property not us

Aug 17, 09:05 PM
Since we just handle the property booking!

Aug 17, 09:06 PM
The rent is collected by the property directly!

Aug 17, 09:06 PM
So you will have to pay the rent directly to the property

Aug 17, 09:07 PM
Once you complete the advance you will get a confirmation email directly from the property and from us too!

Aug 17, 09:07 PM
Payments gone through now

Aug 17, 09:14 PM
Now it’s fine then to view for tomorrow?

Aug 17, 09:16 PM
Just for peace of mind so I know exactly what I’m getting into / paying for, for the next year

Aug 17, 09:16 PM
Have received it from the property but not from you yet

Aug 17, 09:16 PM
Yah will schedule it tomorrow

Aug 17, 09:18 PM

Sep 16, 08:13 AM
Hi Good morning

Sep 16, 08:23 AM
We would be able to submit a payment schedule change request to the city team to review after the booking is at complete. Could you please advise the student to provide one or more of the following: • Student Finance – This needs to show maintenance loan breakdown and not tuition fees. • Letter confirming funding with a breakdown of detailing dates and amounts they would receive. The letter you shared says ‘a maintenance allowance of £17,304 per year (paid in three equal instalments across the academic year: September, January, and April)’, not monthly as you mentioned please double check. • Payslip If the document is in a different currency than GBP please include the exchange rate so that the team can better assess the case. Please also include the student’s proposed plan e.g. the specific dates and amounts they wish to pay. (example format below). Instalment 1 - Day/Month/Year - £XXX.XX Instalment 2 - Day/Month/Year - £XXX.XX Instalment 3 - Day/Month/Year - £XXX.XX

Sep 16, 08:23 AM
Hi i can request this from UCL but the payments will be paid at the beginning of every term

Sep 16, 08:40 AM
I could decide the total rent into 3 instalments then

Sep 16, 08:41 AM
If we will be doing that can I change my contract to the 40 weeks instead of 51 still the same room at Stapleton house Please let me know

Sep 16, 08:44 AM
Please share the above details, as asked along with any prove please

Sep 16, 09:04 AM
I emailed UCL requesting it all

Sep 16, 09:18 AM
Once I get the letter I’ll forward it to you with all details

Sep 16, 09:18 AM
Ok perfect

Sep 16, 10:37 AM
Good evening I have yes to hear from UCL but on the website it specifies that the funds are transferred within 10 days at the start of each term

Sep 16, 04:10 PM
To whom it may concern , Thank you for your support with my accommodation booking. I would like to request that my contract be changed to the 40-week option at £345 per week, which totals £13,800. I would also like my rent to be divided into three instalments aligned with my UCL maintenance allowance payments. As per UCL’s confirmation, my maintenance allowance of £17,304 per year is paid in three equal instalments of £5,768 at the beginning of each academic term (September, January, and April). The allowance is paid directly into my account, and I am due to receive my first instalment immediately upon my arrival in the UK, which is anticipated to be 22 September 2025. Please see my proposed plan below: • Instalment 1 – 22/09/2025 – £4,600 • Instalment 2 – 13/01/2026 – £4,600 • Instalment 3 – 27/04/2026 – £4,600 This plan ensures that each rent instalment is fully covered by the corresponding UCL maintenance instalment, with sufficient funds left for living costs. Thank you for considering my request, and please let me know if there is any additional information you require. Kind regards, Mauricette Isasi

Sep 16, 04:11 PM

Sep 18, 04:52 PM
Hi Mauricette

Sep 18, 06:43 PM
40 weeks at 355/week is a lil difficult. Does 51 weeks at 345/week works?

Sep 18, 06:44 PM
I won’t be able to pay the rent in those instalments with other expenses

Sep 18, 06:45 PM
I understand. Ok let me talk to property to change it

Sep 18, 06:45 PM
Please

Sep 18, 06:45 PM
Ok

Sep 18, 06:46 PM
40 weeks is at 355/week

Sep 18, 06:46 PM
That’s okay

Sep 18, 06:47 PM
OK

Sep 18, 06:47 PM
Thank you Please let me know

Sep 18, 06:54 PM
Sure

Sep 18, 06:54 PM
Good morning I hope you’re well Please let me know if all is sorted ?

Sep 19, 06:51 AM
Could you please update the guarantor with someone who is 25 or above and not a Unite customer? As we mentioned in previous reply, when processing bookings we always offer the maximum instalments available. A payment schedule change request can only be submitted after the booking is at complete

Sep 19, 07:58 AM
We need Guarantor above 25 Please share details accordingly

Sep 19, 07:58 AM

Sep 19, 09:05 AM
Only 51 weeks available

Sep 19, 09:05 AM
40 weeks are sold out

Sep 19, 09:05 AM
Is there really nothing they can do ?

Sep 19, 09:14 AM
If I take the 51 weeks I won’t be able to pay in 3 installments I was planing on taking the 40 for the academic year and then a 15 week over the summer By that time I could’ve saved enough from a part time job

Sep 19, 09:17 AM
No :(

Sep 19, 09:17 AM
This is so stressful What’s the installments going to add up to if I do the 51week ?

Sep 19, 10:29 AM

Sep 19, 10:30 AM

Sep 19, 10:32 AM
Is move in day when I pay the first installment I will be arriving next Tuesday and my bank account will be open then as well to allow me to recieve my maintenance allowance

Speaker A: Hello?
Speaker B: Hello. Hi, am I speaking with Preeti Shuri?
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: Hi, this is Hussain. I'm calling from University College London. Accommodation portal powered by Amber Student. I was calling regarding your accommodation in London.
Speaker A: Yes, please. Yes please.
Speaker B: Perfect. So could you please help me out with few details before I go forward? I can see you have checked. Go Britannia, Kings Cross residence, London. Done. Correct?
Speaker A: Yes, I have.
Speaker B: All right. So did you like that option or would you want me to share you some other options?
Speaker A: No, I think it's just that I'm coming with a 16 year old and the whole point is to make her understand about much accommodation, you know, so I don't want to be. I think the only the I did not understand about this accommodation was if they allow a short stay or is it only stay because it is only for three nights.
Speaker B: Understood. So you said you're looking for a 16 year old. So you're not a student?
Speaker A: No, I'm coming as well. I'm a researcher. I'm the mother.
Speaker B: All right. And perfect. So could you please let me know one more thing like the student will be living alone, right? Or you are planning to move in.
Speaker A: With the student with me.
Speaker B: All right. You're planning to move in with this student?
Speaker A: Yeah. Yes. We need for three nights only.
Speaker B: Understood? Understood. And you are a student also, I assume?
Speaker A: No, I'm a doctor. I'm a surgeon.
Speaker B: You are a working professional researcher.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: All right. All right. And now what is the moving date you're looking for?
Speaker A: But I'm into research right now because are looking for the 8th of December.
Speaker B: The 8th of December.
Speaker A: Yes.
Speaker B: And what is the name of the student?
Speaker A: How does that matter? Can you just help me with accommodation? Is it available or not? And then you can go further.
Speaker B: The thing is I would like to tell you like before moving forward, I need to collect the information. I need to request the property with the custom information that this is the student and this is the sister.
Speaker A: That's no problem. I'll. I will do it my own then. No problem at all. Thank you for your call. Thank you for your call.

Hi Rianne, hope you're doing well.

Oct 28, 07:52 AM
Priyanka this side, I’m reaching out from Amber, the official booking partner of UCL. I tried giving you a call but couldn’t get through, so I’m contacting you here instead.

Oct 28, 07:52 AM
I see you have selected Chapter Old Street, London as your preferred accommodation. Shall we proceed with your booking application for this property, or would you like to know some specific details regarding this property?

Oct 28, 07:53 AM
Hi Priyanka, thanks for reaching out! I'm not sure about the property yet, I didn't know I would go to booking immediately. I actually wanted to get some more information first. I'm not a UK student but a PhD student in Switzerland. I'll go to UCL as a guest researcher but I was wondering if those types of student accommodations are also open for me, since I'm not enrolled at a UK university

Oct 28, 08:12 AM
Also, I was wondering if there is any flexibility regarding the starting date of the rent, because I'm supposed to start the 5th of January already at UCL

Oct 28, 08:14 AM
Hi! No worries at all, happy to clarify. Yes, Chapter Old Street is open to international students, including guest researchers. As long as you can provide proof of your academic status (like a university ID or a letter from UCL confirming your research stay), you’re eligible to stay there.

Oct 28, 08:26 AM
Regarding the start date, early move-in might not be possible, but we’ll need to check with the property team first to confirm availability.

Oct 28, 08:26 AM
Okay thanks! I'll have another look at the properties then and I'll let you know!

Oct 28, 08:31 AM
Okay sure

Hi Rianne, I'm reaching out to check if you're still looking for accommodation or if you've already secured a place.

Nov 4, 09:02 AM
Hi, I'm still checking out some other places so I didn't decide yet

Nov 4, 09:18 AM
Okay

Nov 4, 09:26 AM
Hi! Sorry I decided to go for other housing from a private landlord. Thanks for the help though!

Nov 9, 08:27 PM

hi, sorry for the late response, we can communicate her

Oct 1, 06:56 PM
Hi, i am wondering, if it is possible to extend the tenancy length to 50 weeks for this accommodation (5 Oct 2025 - 26 Sep 2026), and can I visit the room before booking? Thank you.

Oct 1, 06:57 PM
You can request a contract extension by checking with them in advance, and if there’s availability, they’ll accommodate it.

Oct 1, 07:28 PM
You’re welcome to view the accommodation, but only the last two rooms are left, and the next viewing slot is on Monday and there’s a chance the room may be gone by then.

Oct 1, 07:28 PM

Speaker A: Hello?
Speaker B: Hello? Good morning. I had gotten a call from this number an hour back.
Speaker A: Himanshu, this is Priyanka. I'm calling from Amber. Student for you.
Speaker B: Melbourne.
Speaker A: Oh, Melbourne.
Speaker B: Yeah. Hello?
Speaker A: Yes, give me one second. Actually, we have your number saved as Himanshu, so I'm not sure.
Speaker B: Okay. No, it isn't.
Speaker A: Okay, so actually, we received an inquiry, Melvin, that you are looking for student accommodation and, like, we are officially partners with the University College London.
Speaker B: Okay. To my. The phone to my dad. Because he would be the one handing it on.
Speaker A: Correct? Correct. Yes, yes, yes. So actually, we received an inquiry, I think, day before yesterday about the spring property, which is Camden Holly Crescent. This has been sold out.
Speaker B: Now, the one which we had required, which was opening in November.
Speaker A: Yes, Correct. Correct. The Silver Studio. Right? The cam.
Speaker B: Yeah, we are looking something in that Go street only near the ucl.
Speaker A: Me. Okay. Near the usual. Only one second. Give me a minute. And you are looking for a studio room only. Right.
Speaker B: We want independent studio with a pantry, kitchen, everything inside. Like a house inside.
Speaker A: Okay. Okay. So, like, you will be like. You want the entire space for yourself. You don't want to share it with anyone else, right?
Speaker B: No. No.
Speaker A: Okay, got it. Just give me one second. Let me just see what options we have.
Speaker B: Yep.
Speaker A: Do you have any budget, Melvin? So, like, would anything work? Or, like, do you, like, do you have any specific budget?
Speaker B: All. What's your name? Sorry? What's your name?
Speaker A: Priyanka.
Speaker B: Priyanka. Listen, I'm Melvin's father, actually. So the thing is not actually the budget or something. I want to be a little bit independent and close to the college. So if I go and say the budget is the second part for me, but I preferably have a decent independent thing. We don't want any others, you know, I mean, like, let him have his own self, by his own self, because he's into the postgraduate studies and let him. He has a lot of work to do.
Speaker A: Okay, Right. So you are like. You don't have any budget constraints. You just need something closer to the university and, like, whatever preferences you have related to the room. Right. You want that?
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker A: One minute. I'll help you with the best options we have. Actually, we had one property I'm just taking, but it's still available. Actually, we have this property which is called IQ City London. This is the closest to this university. Apart from this, we have one other property, which is Ragbone Place, but in that property, like, that is the closest because that is 15 minutes of walking distance. But right now, I cannot see Any studio rooms over there? They only have the shared room. So I'm skipping this option. So after this, the cheapest or sorry, the closest option to the university that we have. This is IQ City London. And here we have the corporate studio. Starting like the moving date will start from the 4th of October. The duration is 40 weeks. The price would be 447 pounds per week. I'll just share a link with you. So just check out the property.
Speaker B: Is it possible for us to buy.
Speaker A: Sorry sir, actually your voice.
Speaker B: Is it possible. Is it possible for me to go and have a view?
Speaker A: Let me just check if any wing slots are available. I'm not sure if you will be able to, you know, view the property today. Because the slots wouldn't be available tomorrow morning. I'm just checking for tomorrow. So give me one moment.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: I'm just sharing this option on your WhatsApp number. Because I think Melvin's number is not on WhatsApp.
Speaker B: Sir. Yeah, we are using the Dubai number. Sorry.
Speaker A: It's like we have a lot of studio rooms so you can just check them out. I'm just sharing the prices and all those things over here on WhatsApp. And I'm just also checking the view slot if it is available for tomorrow. So sorry.
Speaker B: Priyanka, if I give you my Dubai number can you share it on that number for WhatsApp?
Speaker A: Yes, sure sir, I can. I'll just make a note of the number. Give me one minute.
Speaker B: Yeah. 0097-197150-50849-849-8871.
Speaker A: What will be the phone code for this? Yeah.
Speaker B: 00971. That's the one what I gave you, you, directly. 00971. I gave you now.
Speaker A: Yes. Okay. I have just shared that. Let it get to you. Okay. So this is the option that I have shared to you. I'm just checking for the viewing. So give me one minute.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker A: What would be your preferred time slots for tomorrow?
Speaker B: Tomorrow? Once again, Baba. Baba, tomorrow.
Speaker A: What time is your class?
Speaker B: So tomorrow I will prefer something around let's say nine. Between 9:30.
Speaker A: 9:30, 10:00am yeah.
Speaker B: Morning.
Speaker A: No sir, actually the time slots start.
Speaker B: From 11am 11 to what time?
Speaker A: 11 till evening. We have like till 6. You can use the property B.
Speaker B: What time you get over tomorrow? Okay. So can I get it at. Okay. How far it is from the UCL to that place?
Speaker A: Sir, as I mentioned it's two miles. So it will be the walking distance. I guess 20 minutes. 15 to 20. No, no. I'm so sorry sir. It will be 35 to 40. 40. 45. So we have 45 minutes or a card. Yes.
Speaker B: Ah no, that's very common. Is the one what you all had advertised why I put the one what you learned advertised. It was like four minutes walking and it was starting that you all told over that this will be available from 1st of November but that is gone your thing property.
Speaker A: So you're talking about.
Speaker B: I replied to that email. What was that? I send an interesting arrow for the inquiry that was starting from. That was something London.
Speaker A: Yes, but that property is completely sold out. This is what I was saying because you know like it just took two days. So we don't have a lot of room rooms left. So even at this property you will only see the last one or two rooms are left, not more than that. So if you take like if you delay by even a couple of days. So you will lose out on this option. So that's the thing.
Speaker B: Because see I also got it in Kings Cross. You know even as from the UCL itself he didn't like want to be that far. So that we rejected for the ucl. So this becomes. So if you're talking about this again, 30, 35 minutes becomes the same thing for us. So what I would prefer we will keep this details of ours in your contact list with even after a month if you come across any property which is closest within the walking distance of like 5 to 10 minutes. Even up till like Russell Square or Travis Square or gonna go north or Go street. If you get any input in that areas, please give us the link into that. We'll pick it up immediately.
Speaker A: Sure, sure. So sir, basically he's looking for November intake, right.
Speaker B: I mean we are already here in uk. He is already started but we are staying in a brother's place. We have like our own accommodation here but we are a little bit far away. He's staying in Heathrow. So from there to go it's taking a long time for us by Metro it takes a one hour. So we still want something closer because of time saving.
Speaker A: Right, Right, right sir. Like if you really need something closer like this is the like what to say. It's very expensive option. If you want I can just share it with you. This is called AXO Oxford circles. This is 12 minutes of walking distance like 0.5 miles from the university. And the price for the studio room here starts with 592 pounds per week.
Speaker B: And this includes all the bills?
Speaker A: Yes, including all the bills. Everything. This is a studio Room with a private kitchen. Everything is attached. A microwave, oven, fridge, freezer. Everything is provided in the kitchen itself.
Speaker B: Sorry, send me that link. Please send me that link. I will go to that and I will give you a call back on that. And keep this contact details in your list. We will still prefer to have. We are ready to wait another one month also. Not a problem.
Speaker A: Yes, yes, sir, I'll just, you know, check it out. But most probably whatever options we have though like that might be sold out and we are not accepting any properties by November.
Speaker B: By November.
Speaker A: But I'll just. Yes, yes, yes. So we are not expecting any new property. So the new properties will be, you know, it will be available after December. Like for January intake. Nothing for November intake. We usually have. So whatever the rooms are left over, they, you know, they start renting it out for November. That's.
Speaker B: Oh, okay, okay. Got your point. Yeah. So can you send me this one also what you are saying like which is the processor now you give me the Copper Studio. Bronze Studio. Silver Studio. Silver Studio. What is this? Actually.
Speaker A: Yes, yes, I'll just share this link also for axo. One second, sir.
Speaker B: It.
Speaker A: So I have just shared you the link. You could see the walking distance and all those things from. Okay, this is the walking distance to non density Center. I'll just share the walking distance from the university.
Speaker B: So Oxford Circuit. That is the one you saying. Right. So if I click on that link I will get the details. Right?
Speaker A: Right. I'm from University College London, sir. It will be just 12 minutes of walking distance. I have mistakenly shared you the details from the London. London City Center. I just, you know, edit this option and I'll make it distance from the university. Okay. You would be able to see the distance from the Universal team.
Speaker B: Okay. I'll have a look on this all the strings and give you a reply back on the WhatsApp. You will have the details. Right? I'll reply to this WhatsApp. Yeah.
Speaker A: Yes. Yes sir, you can.
Speaker B: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Give me, let's say one or two hours I'll do into that and if required I'll ask for a vision for tomorrow slot in the evening. No problem. But let me just have a look into this post.
Speaker A: Sure, sure. So let me know if you have any more questions.

Speaker B: No, they haven't. I've been. I've been. They did call me though and they said they're going to sort it out and then I didn't end up getting. Getting a response back. So then I emailed them again and still nothing.
Speaker A: I think that this must be because of the move in since they have to move in place alongside now, so they are a bit busy. Although it will be done by Monday since it's a weekend like today and.
Speaker B: Tomorrow, it will.

Speaker B: Okay, thank you so much. Thank you.

Speaker B: Hello?
Speaker A: Yeah, hello, Mustafa from Ambro.
Speaker B: Oh, hi. Yes, I forgot to inform you, I booked it through the website directly itself.
Speaker A: Okay, that is not an issue. Even if you have booked it directly, can you please do one thing? Can you please share me the tenancy agreement or at least like the signing and the page so that I can also mark this completed from my end? Although have they agreed for the payment terms?
Speaker B: Yeah, it's all been set up. I chose to go through the website directly instead because Amber wants to charge me like some processing fee.
Speaker A: No, no, actually we did not charge you. That is an exception for UC student. You could have just asked me for that. And nonetheless, it's totally fine. It's totally fine. You do not need to do anything again. Just share with the contract once and confirm if everything is settled on the WhatsApp so that I can pass this as close from my end. Okay?
Speaker B: All right, no worries. Thank you.
Speaker A: Just do it as soon as possible, please.
Speaker B: Sorry?
Speaker A: Just do it as soon as possible. Yeah, okay.
Speaker B: All right, thank you.

Please share it to me

Sep 26, 11:29 AM
You can download it by logging into the portal

Sep 26, 11:31 AM
Hi, I won’t be sharing my booking reference. I secured the accommodation directly at a cheaper rate, avoiding the non-refundable booking fee Amber was trying to charge. When we first spoke, you also shared another student’s personal details with me. That was a serious breach of privacy and made me very uncomfortable. For these reasons, I do not want any further contact. Please close my enquiry on your side. If I am contacted again, I will have no choice but to report this matter to UCL.

Sep 26, 01:49 PM
I have shared with you the screenshot of the payment terms because that is something which won't cause an issue rest assured everything is confidential here

Sep 26, 01:50 PM
We do not want the contract here you all I want which room type booked along side the pricing and the duration

Sep 26, 01:51 PM
Will be happy to close this

Sep 26, 01:51 PM
Plus I have assisted you through all your questions so don't worry Amber is a safe place for students to book an accommodation
