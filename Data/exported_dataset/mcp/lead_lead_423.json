Yes. Yes.\nSpeaker A: Would you like to proceed with the booking for that?\nSpeaker B: Not yet. Sorry, I'm on the road. I been looking through the rooms yesterday and I've not decided yet.\nSpeaker A: Okay. And when should I check with you? When would you have made a decision?\nSpeaker B: If I do make a decision, I'll definitely write you an email.\nSpeaker A: Okay. I also dropped your text on WhatsApp. Did you receive my text?\nSpeaker B: I think I saw a text, yes.\nSpeaker A: Okay. So if at all you decide to move forward with the booking, or if you'd like to explore any other options, or I have any questions, you can drop me a text on WhatsApp, give me a call, write me an email, whatever is convenient to you.\nSpeaker B: Okay? Sure. Yes. Thank you.\nSpeaker A: All right, thank you. Bye. Bye.\nSpeaker B: Bye.",
