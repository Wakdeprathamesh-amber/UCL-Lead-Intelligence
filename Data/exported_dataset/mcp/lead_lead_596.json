Yeah, hi Neil, how are you doing?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, good, thanks.\nSpeaker B: Neil, this is Hussain, I'm calling regarding your accommodation. I can see you have registered in our website of ucl powered by Amber.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, our daughter.\nSpeaker B: Yes, yeah, perfect, perfect. So you are looking for accommodation, correct?\nSpeaker A: Yes, that's right.\nSpeaker B: Perfect. And what are your requirements for your accommodation?\nSpeaker A: We're looking for ideally a studio with access to our own cooking facilities and ensuite as close to UCL as possible.\nSpeaker B: Close to UCL as possible. I got you. And what would be your budget for your accommodation?\nSpeaker A: At the moment we don't, we don't really have a budget in mind. We're just trying to find what there is, what there is actually available. Obviously it's last minute, is accepted through clearing so.\nSpeaker B: Understood. Just one second. And now do you have any room preferences?\nSpeaker A: Any.\nSpeaker B: Sorry, do you have any room preferences?\nSpeaker A: No.\nSpeaker B: Okay, allow me a moment.\nSpeaker A: Sorry, where are you calling from?\nSpeaker B: I'm calling from UCL accommodation.\nSpeaker A: Oh, okay, yeah.\nSpeaker B: Perfect. Just allow me a moment. And you are planning to move in on the 30th of August?\nSpeaker A: It would be. Yeah, beginning of September.\nSpeaker B: Okay. In September.\nSpeaker A: Right, yeah.\nSpeaker B: All right. Do you have a WhatsApp on the same number?\nSpeaker A: Sorry, you're very quiet. It's very breaking up here. I can't, can't hear you very well.\nSpeaker B: I was asking you, do you have WhatsApp on the same number on this number?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, you can contact me on this number.\nSpeaker B: All right. I'm just sharing you one property. Yeah, the name of the property is IQ Arcade London and IQ City London. Okay. In IQ Arcade London there is a £750 cash back for the student who are booking this accommodation.\nSpeaker A: Right.\nSpeaker B: Currently we have Silver Room plus available for 270 pounds and it is just as 30 minutes of a bus commute from the university, 2.5 miles from the university.\nSpeaker A: Okay, can you possibly email me details?\nSpeaker B: Pardon?\nSpeaker A: Would you be able to email me details?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I can, I can email you all the details. But what would be more convenient? The email or the WhatsApp email would be more convenient. Okay, I am sharing it on the email. This one second. You, your bills will be included over here. Plus you will also get a constant insurance. So basically the content insurance will mean if anything, if any of your item that you're going to carry with you get damaged because of water leakage, flood or anything, or get stolen, the property will pay for it.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And at this end of the moment we, there's you know, like you are aware there is not much of accommodations left anymore.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: This is one of the finest, which I. I personally will recommend to you. Yeah, just sharing it this moment.\nSpeaker A: Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, if you can say. If you can email that across to me, that'd be brilliant.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, perfect. Yeah, I will send you the email after this call. All right, Neil, it was lovely talking to you. Please feel free to reach out.\nSpeaker A: Brilliant. Thanks. Now, bye.",
