      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello?\nSpeaker B: Hello? Good morning. I had gotten a call from this number an hour back.\nSpeaker A: Himanshu, this is Priyanka. I'm calling from Amber. Student for you.\nSpeaker B: Melbourne.\nSpeaker A: Oh, Melbourne.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. Hello?\nSpeaker A: Yes, give me one second. Actually, we have your number saved as Himanshu, so I'm not sure.\nSpeaker B: Okay. No, it isn't.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so actually, we received an inquiry, Melvin, that you are looking for student accommodation and, like, we are officially partners with the University College London.\nSpeaker B: Okay. To my. The phone to my dad. Because he would be the one handing it on.\nSpeaker A: Correct? Correct. Yes, yes, yes. So actually, we received an inquiry, I think, day before yesterday about the spring property, which is Camden Holly Crescent. This has been sold out.\nSpeaker B: Now, the one which we had required, which was opening in November.\nSpeaker A: Yes, Correct. Correct. The Silver Studio. Right? The cam.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, we are looking something in that Go street only near the ucl.\nSpeaker A: Me. Okay. Near the usual. Only one second. Give me a minute. And you are looking for a studio room only. Right.\nSpeaker B: We want independent studio with a pantry, kitchen, everything inside. Like a house inside.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Okay. So, like, you will be like. You want the entire space for yourself. You don't want to share it with anyone else, right?\nSpeaker B: No. No.\nSpeaker A: Okay, got it. Just give me one second. Let me just see what options we have.\nSpeaker B: Yep.\nSpeaker A: Do you have any budget, Melvin? So, like, would anything work? Or, like, do you, like, do you have any specific budget?\nSpeaker B: All. What's your name? Sorry? What's your name?\nSpeaker A: Priyanka.\nSpeaker B: Priyanka. Listen, I'm Melvin's father, actually. So the thing is not actually the budget or something. I want to be a little bit independent and close to the college. So if I go and say the budget is the second part for me, but I preferably have a decent independent thing. We don't want any others, you know, I mean, like, let him have his own self, by his own self, because he's into the postgraduate studies and let him. He has a lot of work to do.\nSpeaker A: Okay, Right. So you are like. You don't have any budget constraints. You just need something closer to the university and, like, whatever preferences you have related to the room. Right. You want that?\nSpeaker B: Yes.\nSpeaker A: One minute. I'll help you with the best options we have. Actually, we had one property I'm just taking, but it's still available. Actually, we have this property which is called IQ City London. This is the closest to this university. Apart from this, we have one other property, which is Ragbone Place, but in that property, like, that is the closest because that is 15 minutes of walking distance. But right now, I cannot see Any studio rooms over there? They only have the shared room. So I'm skipping this option. So after this, the cheapest or sorry, the closest option to the university that we have. This is IQ City London. And here we have the corporate studio. Starting like the moving date will start from the 4th of October. The duration is 40 weeks. The price would be 447 pounds per week. I'll just share a link with you. So just check out the property.\nSpeaker B: Is it possible for us to buy.\nSpeaker A: Sorry sir, actually your voice.\nSpeaker B: Is it possible. Is it possible for me to go and have a view?\nSpeaker A: Let me just check if any wing slots are available. I'm not sure if you will be able to, you know, view the property today. Because the slots wouldn't be available tomorrow morning. I'm just checking for tomorrow. So give me one moment.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: I'm just sharing this option on your WhatsApp number. Because I think Melvin's number is not on WhatsApp.\nSpeaker B: Sir. Yeah, we are using the Dubai number. Sorry.\nSpeaker A: It's like we have a lot of studio rooms so you can just check them out. I'm just sharing the prices and all those things over here on WhatsApp. And I'm just also checking the view slot if it is available for tomorrow. So sorry.\nSpeaker B: Priyanka, if I give you my Dubai number can you share it on that number for WhatsApp?\nSpeaker A: Yes, sure sir, I can. I'll just make a note of the number. Give me one minute.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. 00971-9717-150508-49849-8871.\nSpeaker A: What will be the phone code for this? Yeah.\nSpeaker B: 00971. That's the one what I gave you know directly. 00971. I gave you now.\nSpeaker A: Yes. Okay. I have just shared that. Let it get to you. Okay. So this is the option that I have shared to you. I'm just checking for the viewing. So give me one minute.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: What would be your preferred time slots for tomorrow?\nSpeaker B: Tomorrow? Once again, Baba. Baba, tomorrow.\nSpeaker A: What time is your class?\nSpeaker B: So tomorrow I will prefer something around let's say nine. Between 9:30.\nSpeaker A: 9:30, 10:00am yeah.\nSpeaker B: Morning.\nSpeaker A: No sir, actually the time slots start.\nSpeaker B: From 11am 11 to what time?\nSpeaker A: 11 till evening. We have like till 6. You can use the property B.\nSpeaker B: What time you get over tomorrow? Okay. So can I get it at. Okay. How far it is from the UCL to that place?\nSpeaker A: Sir, as I mentioned it's two miles. So it will be the walking distance. I guess 20 minutes. 15 to 20. No, no. I'm so sorry sir. It will be 35 to 40. 40. 45. So we have 45 minutes or a card. Yes.\nSpeaker B: Ah no, that's very common. Is the one what you all had advertised why I put the one what you learned advertised. It was like four minutes walking and it was starting that you all told over that this will be available from 1st of November but that is gone your thing property.\nSpeaker A: So you're talking about.\nSpeaker B: I replied to that email. What was that? I send an interesting arrow for the inquiry that was starting from. That was something London.\nSpeaker A: Yes, but that property is completely sold out. This is what I was saying because you know like it just took two days. So we don't have a lot of room rooms left. So even at this property you will only see the last one or two rooms are left, not more than that. So if you take like if you delay by even a couple of days. So you will lose out on this option. So that's the thing.\nSpeaker B: Because see I also got it in Kings Cross. You know even as from the UCL itself he didn't like want to be that far. So that we rejected for the ucl. So this becomes. So if you're talking about this again, 30, 35 minutes becomes the same thing for us. So what I would prefer we will keep this details of ours in your contact list with even after a month if you come across any property which is closest within the walking distance of like 5 to 10 minutes. Even up till like Russell Square or Travis Square or gonna go north or Go street. If you get any input in that areas, please give us the link into that. We'll pick it up immediately.\nSpeaker A: Sure, sure. So sir, basically he's looking for November intake, right.\nSpeaker B: I mean we are already here in uk. He is already started but we are staying in a brother's place. We have like our own accommodation here but we are a little bit far away. He's staying in Heathrow. So from there to go it's taking a long time for us by Metro it takes a one hour. So we still want something closer because of time saving.\nSpeaker A: Right, Right, right sir. Like if you really need something closer like this is the like what to say. It's very expensive option. If you want I can just share it with you. This is called AXO Oxford circles. This is 12 minutes of walking distance like 0.5 miles from the university. And the price for the studio room here starts with 592 pounds per week.\nSpeaker B: And this includes all the bills?\nSpeaker A: Yes, including all the bills. Everything. This is a studio Room with a private kitchen. Everything is attached. A microwave, oven, fridge, freezer. Everything is provided in the kitchen itself.\nSpeaker B: Sorry, send me that link. Please send me that link. I will go to that and I will give you a call back on that. And keep this contact details in your list. We will still prefer to have. We are ready to wait another one month also. Not a problem.\nSpeaker A: Yes, yes, sir, I'll just, you know, check it out. But most probably whatever options we have though like that might be sold out and we are not accepting any properties by November.\nSpeaker B: By November.\nSpeaker A: But I'll just. Yes, yes, yes. So we are not expecting any new property. So the new properties will be, you know, it will be available after December. Like for January intake. Nothing for November intake. We usually have. So whatever the rooms are left over, they, you know, they start renting it out for November. That's.\nSpeaker B: Oh, okay, okay. Got your point. Yeah. So can you send me this one also what you are saying like which is the processor now you give me the Copper Studio. Bronze Studio. Silver Studio. Silver Studio. What is this? Actually.\nSpeaker A: Yes, yes, I'll just share this link also for axo. One second, sir.\nSpeaker B: It.\nSpeaker A: So I have just shared you the link. You could see the walking distance and all those things from. Okay, this is the walking distance to non density Center. I'll just share the walking distance from the university.\nSpeaker B: So Oxford Circuit. That is the one you saying. Right. So if I click on that link I will get the details. Right?\nSpeaker A: Right. I'm from University College London, sir. It will be just 12 minutes of walking distance. I have mistakenly shared you the details from the London. London City Center. I just, you know, edit this option and I'll make it distance from the university. Okay. You would be able to see the distance from the Universal team.\nSpeaker B: Okay. I'll have a look on this all the strings and give you a reply back on the WhatsApp. You will have the details. Right? I'll reply to this WhatsApp. Yeah.\nSpeaker A: Yes. Yes sir, you can.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Yeah. Okay. Give me, let's say one or two hours I'll do into that and if required I'll ask for a vision for tomorrow slot in the evening. No problem. But let me just have a look into this post.\nSpeaker A: Sure, sure. So let me know if you have any more questions.\nSpeaker B: Sure. Thank you very much, Bianca.
