      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello? Yes, am I speaking with Shori here? Yeah, sure, the site calling you from Ambit. Okay, sorry, I can see that you have. You have filled the booking form for Picardley Code London, correct?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I just did it.\nSpeaker A: So, just wanted to confirm here. I was processing your application at the moment. Can you please confirm which payment method that you wish to proceed? Do you wish to pay the rent and installment or like you would be like to be the rent of it?\nSpeaker B: Which payment method I would like to pay for?\nSpeaker A: Yes, correct. And there are two payment methods. The one is upfront means that you have to pay for the whole 51 week. That's the first one. The second one is that you can pay the rent in four installments. So which method that you wish to proceed with?\nSpeaker B: Do I have to give you this information now? Because I'd like to confirm it with my parents first.\nSpeaker A: You can do one thing here. I mean. Okay, you can go for installment at the moment. Since there is no need of UK based guarantor, your father or mother, anyone can become the guarantor for you. Currently I'm able to see here that you have mentioned your parent means your, I guess your father as the emergency contact. So I can make you a guarantor as a woman and you can get four installment. And suppose if you later on decided that I will pay in full. All we have to do is we need to mail the property and you can make the payment in full. Because from changing installment to one time, that would be an easy thing. But suppose if we process this at one time and later on you wish to change it to installment, it can create a cost.\nSpeaker B: Okay, okay. So it can be changed later as well.\nSpeaker A: Absolutely. And also there is no extra charge for installment. And the property is offering you a £400 of cash back as well. So if we delay this, we might lose on this. Or even the room can sold out because I can see only three rooms are available at the moment. Okay, I'll.\nSpeaker B: Can we go ahead with the installments then? Yes.\nSpeaker A: Can you please mention your course? Which course are you going for?\nSpeaker B: Do you need the UCAS number or something?\nSpeaker A: No, no, just the course name can be the one.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, so it's Philosophy at UCL at uc. Philosophy at UCL University College London. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Oh yes we do. We are the official accommodation partner. I hope that you will be visiting. Yes, we are the official partners, not worry. Philosophy. The course name is. Is it? Okay. Philosophy at ucl. Product. Product. Product Installment. I have proceeded this application at the moment. Although I'll do one more thing here. I'll drop your WhatsApp text straight away so that if I need any information while processing your application, you can just share it to me over the WhatsApp chat works.\nSpeaker B: Okay? The one that just said hello. This one? Yes, yes, got it. So if you need any information from me, please let me know.\nSpeaker A: I'll drop it here.\nSpeaker B: Okay, Sure.\nSpeaker A: I will do that.\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you.",
