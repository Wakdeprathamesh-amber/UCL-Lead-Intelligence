I’m part of the Access UCL programme, which supports students from underrepresented and disadvantaged backgrounds in accessing and succeeding at university.\n\nI’m currently looking to secure accommodation and am particularly interested in the most basic private option available - ideally a Bronze Studio at Chapter King’s Cross. I understand the rates for these studios range from around £575 to £620 per week, and while this is slightly above my ideal range (which is approximately £1,800–£2,000pcm including bills, with £2,000 being the very top end of my budget), I would be grateful to explore whether anything might be possible within or close to that range.\n\nInitially, I had planned to live in private accommodation and did not re-apply for UCL-managed housing. However, I only recently found out that most private providers require a UK-based guarantor with an income of at least three times the annual rent - something I do not have. I also don't have the financial means to pay six months’ rent upfront without significant difficulty. I was unaware of these requirements at the time, which unfortunately led to me missing the deadline for UCL accommodation under the assumption that private housing would be accessible.\n\nI’ve been actively exploring all available accommodation options within and around my budget, but Chapter King’s Cross stands out as the most viable due to its flexibility and location. \nFrom my understanding, Chapter offers more flexible payment terms (1, 2, or 4 instalments) and does not impose income-based guarantor thresholds. This makes Chapter King’s Cross one of the few realistic and suitable options for me given my current circumstances. I was wondering if there might be any UCL-related discounts or offers that I may be eligible for, or if there are any special considerations that could be made in light of my situation and my participation in the Access UCL programme. I also understand that in the past, some Chapter properties have offered student discounts through booking platforms such as Amber - I wasn’t sure if similar arrangements are still in place or if there’s anything comparable available when booking directly. I’m happy to provide proof of my participation in the programme if any offers or considerations are available.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice or support you can offer, as Chapter King’s Cross is exactly the kind of environment I’m hoping to live in during my second year at university and hopefully my third. It’s within walking distance of UCL, and I feel genuinely safe in the area - both of which are very important to me, especially given the demands of my architecture course and the long hours I often spend on campus. Other Chapter locations, such as Islington, are slightly more affordable but would require additional travel and are in areas where I wouldn’t feel as comfortable commuting to and from university, particularly later in the day given my strenuous course. For those reasons, King’s Cross is my first choice.\n\nIf there are any cancellations, flexible options, or alternative arrangements that become available, I’d be very keen to explore them as soon as possible.\n\nThank you very much for your time and consideration - I truly appreciate anything you may be able to do and completely understand if you're not able to help.\n\nKind regards,\nKirsten Pacey.\n_\n\n\n^I have pasted the email above. I am still waiting a response but would like to know if there is anything you can do in the meantime.\n\nThank you.\n\nKind regards,\nKirsten.",
