      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello? Hello, yeah, I'm actually Sophie here.\nSpeaker B: Hi.\nSpeaker A: Hi Sophie, Sophie Rush of the site calling you from AM Student. This call is regarding your student accommodation or IQ stalling board.\nSpeaker B: Yes, in accommodation. Okay, sorry.\nSpeaker A: I can see that you have filled a booking form for copper onset Premium IQ Stalling Road London. Correct?\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: Yeah. So I mean we are yet to receive the deposit for the property. Along with that there is some missing details like you haven't mentioned the guarantor details. The guarantor can be anyone from your family. It can be a father or mother or any sibling that is above 25 years of age.\nSpeaker B: I haven't really decided on it yet.\nSpeaker A: Can you please repeat that once again?\nSpeaker B: I'm not 100 dead set on it. So it's not complete yet. I'm still looking for other properties that are closer to my uni.\nSpeaker A: And what's the budget that you'll be having?\nSpeaker B: Sorry, I can't hear you very well, there's a lot of background noise.\nSpeaker A: Is it fine if I connect you on WhatsApp?\nSpeaker B: I guess so. I already have someone that kind of working for me on WhatsApp. I'm ready, so maybe not this time.\nSpeaker A: So like you have already someone who is working for your student accommodation, is it correct?\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: And is it from Amber student or like is it any friend of yours?\nSpeaker B: It's from Shun Ako.\nSpeaker A: Student accommodation. Correct. Okay, that's not an issue. You, we can still, you know, had a conversation because we are the official student accommodation partner for your university. That's the only reason you have been redirected to our website. We are the official partner of University College London, so that won't be an issue. I can do one thing here. You can just share me what kind of preference that you have along with the budget so that I can share you some more options regarding the same. And also I can provide you certain amount of cashback for IQ stalling code. Okay. Because for now I can see there is a cashback of £500 for IQ stalling code. So that's a huge cash back.\nSpeaker B: Okay, not gonna lie, I don't know what cashback is. So.\nSpeaker A: The cashback generally means once you move in into the property, the property will hand you over a 500 pounds of physical card which you can use anywhere in London. So you can spend that £500 anywhere, be it uber beat at a restaurant, shopping anywhere. The card have a limit of £500. So that is what the call cashback. And some property, what they do some property adjust those cash back into the Total rent. But this property IQ stall code provide you a physical card of £500. That is what the cashback is. Cashback means that the property is giving something for booking their property.\nSpeaker B: Ah, see. Okay, thank you.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so I'll do one thing here. I. I hope that you'll be able to hear me now. So this property, let me tell you about this property but not more than. It's not going to take more than five minutes. The property offers four installment payment plan means that you can pay the entire rent in four installment and the first installment will be due in the month of September. Before that second will be due in the month of December and then January or February, then in the month of April. So there will be four installments. Everything will be mentioned in the contract. And along with that here I can see the property is offering a very good list of amenities like the bills are all included like WI fi, heater, electricity, water content, insurance events are also included and it's nearby the city center. So you will be having a great public transport link. You're going for University Coral City, London. Correct. Ucl. So let me check, let me check the distance from just a moment. Okay, so this is actually 4 to 5 miles from UCL. So it's not a big distance. It will take like 20 to 25 minutes of your via commute.\nSpeaker B: That's not too bad.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, exactly. That is it. I mean if I, if I were to you. Because we have booked many University College London students like BIM student, UCL student. They have opted for IQ properties or chapter properties because they are a good properties. They offer varying cashbacks along with good experience to the students who are coming by for the academic year of 2025-26.\nSpeaker B: I do have a budget of around 250 but I'll push it to 260 if I need to.\nSpeaker A: And what's the room type that you'll be looking for? Is it a private room, private washroom or shared kitchen?\nSpeaker B: I don't have a preference for room as long as it's not a dormitory. As long as it's not something like a twin room. I just want like a private room. But I don't care if it's ensuite or not.\nSpeaker A: Got it, got it. Let me just check. So I mean if I recommend you on an honest basis. So IQ stalling code is a good fit for you because it is providing you an ensuite room along with the same range. Since London is already expensive and the nearby property which you can offer is like 300£400 for the room type that you'll be preferring. Even the washroom is shared. So on that basis I would recommend you this property can suits you very best since it comes with everything. It comes with private room, private washroom and the kitchen is the only sharing part. That is it. So I recommend you this, you can go for this. And also they're offering you a £500 of cash back. And £500 is not a small amount, Correct, a good amount of money. So I will recommend you to go for that. That's. That is something what I can offer you. If you want I can share you some other properties as well. But they will be slightly above your budget and the properties which are well within the budget of youth, they might be not very liking, they might not be very good in terms of experience of the student.\nSpeaker B: Another preference I have is that it must be within like 30 minutes to uni to my like department. At the first it was like within 20 minutes, but if it's 30 I'll have a look.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so the best guess is that you want to have only 20 minutes. Correct. Let me check, let me tell you the exact distance. Just a moment. So IQ 5B, IQ City Paris. Let me tell you the exact distance. IQ Stalling. So. University College London, your university is in on God Street. Correct.\nSpeaker B: Sorry, what was that?\nSpeaker A: Your university is in which state? Is it in Richbin street or like is it in the G Street?\nSpeaker B: I don't really know, I just know it's in Bloomsbury.\nSpeaker A: Oh, Bloomsbury. Okay, let me check. So Blooms. Actually bloomsbury is like 10 miles from IQ Stirling code. So it will take 35 to 40 minutes at least of you. It's not well within the 30 minutes of range that you'll be looking forward to.\nSpeaker B: Wait, sorry, what did you say?\nSpeaker A: So IQ stalling code and your university at a distance of 10 miles. So it will take 35.\nSpeaker B: Okay, so the thing is I kind of just took this for a different one because I sent like a viewing request for an IQV arcade and that's 22 minutes by pass.\nSpeaker A: Absolutely IQ. The arcade is 2.8 miles from the university and it is 28, 25 minutes. I can do that. IQ Arcade, that's not an issue. If you can just give me a thumbs up that if you wish to proceed ahead with IQ Arcade I will be able to do that. And along with that IQ Arcade is also offering a £500 of cashback, same like IQ stolen code and it's well within the range of use and it's A copper room means that your room will be private, your washroom and the kitchen will be on sharing basis. And you can take two tenancies. Either you can take 39 weeks or 43 weeks.\nSpeaker B: The thing is, it's just that when I was like researching deep into this place because obviously I want to be sure. I don't know, I didn't see a lot of reviews on it. And a lot of them were telling me about like infestations and stuff or like the management team not doing anything about problems. So I kind of want to have a viewing of the place first before I go ahead with anything to like fully confirm that things have changed to see the room for myself.\nSpeaker A: And when would you like to have the viewing?\nSpeaker B: I booked the viewing for tomorrow to give them more time to respond to me.\nSpeaker A: Should I do it for you? Like should I arrange the viewing?\nSpeaker B: Because you can do this?\nSpeaker A: Yes, absolutely, I can do that. You want to have a physical viewing or a virtual viewing?\nSpeaker B: I'll have a virtual viewing first. But if I feel it's like just inadequate, then I just go in a person viewing. So just virtual viewing first.\nSpeaker A: Virtual wing. Just a moment. So let me check when the virtual wings are available. Okay, so today is 16 and let me tell you. Okay, so they are available from 11 o'. Clock. Will that be okay with you? I guess they can provide you.\nSpeaker B: That'd be great.\nSpeaker A: Let me check if I can erase that. The student. Just a moment. Your details are okay. Your name is already there, Sophie. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Yep.\nSpeaker A: IQ Architect is a good property. They have changed a lot. We have a special partnership with them and they have changed their everything, interior and everything. If you can just see the Google reviews for now it's 4.1. Previously it was 3.2. So the standard have been increased. You don't have to worry on those parts.\nSpeaker B: Okay, that's good to hear.\nSpeaker A: Email address? Your email address is all in there, Sophie. 8846gmail. Okay, so I mean. Can you please check your email that if you have received a viewing request from the IQ property. I have submitted the request for a virtual viewing.\nSpeaker B: Sorry, what was that?\nSpeaker A: What I'm saying here is can you please check your email id? You must have received an email from the IQ student regarding the viewing.\nSpeaker B: Yep, I'll check right now. Wait there. I need to go to a place with better signal. This room is not very good.\nSpeaker A: Can you please repeat that? Wait there.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: Yep. I just got sent something right now.\nSpeaker A: Insect.\nSpeaker B: Wait, I have like an email.\nSpeaker A: You got an email? From IQ students, correct?\nSpeaker B: Yep, just now.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so what I. What I have done here is I've scheduled a viewing for today. Hopefully they will be able to provide a viewing for today, a virtual viewing. And on the basis of that, you can decide whether you wish to proceed ahead or like you want to wish another property. I hope that's okay.\nSpeaker B: I got two emails and it says that they're both tomorrow.\nSpeaker A: Okay. They're both tomorrow?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, they're both tomorrow and at five. And it's not a confirmation. It says like, Wait, it just says like, we'll get in touch with you as soon as we can. So if it is available, we'll rearrange it for you.\nSpeaker A: Do not worry, they will be able to confirm you the viewing very soon. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: So meanwhile, can you please confirm if I can block the room for you at I.Q. the arcade?\nSpeaker B: Yeah. Okay. For that one.\nSpeaker A: Okay. The reason why I'm asking you so because even if you like the property, you already have a room over there and you only need to do is you need to pay the deposit. So what I'm asking here is you don't have to pay us anything. You don't have to pay anything to the property before the viewing. Just block the roof for now. And then once you have the viewing and you decided to proceed ahead, you can just make the payment and block the room. Because the room can be sold out very soon. That's the only reason I'm guiding you to block it as soon as possible.\nSpeaker B: So don't I need to make a booking fee for that?\nSpeaker A: No, you don't have to be even a single penny. So all you need to do is you need to. You need to share me the guarantor details. Means that your father or mother, anyone from your family, so that I can process this ahead and prob room for you. And later on, if you wish to proceed ahead with the property, you can just make the payment. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And then after the payment, I sign the contract?\nSpeaker A: Absolutely. After you sign the contract, the guarantor will also receive a contract because the current the contract needs to be signed by the student, the guarantor of the student, and then the property himself directly. So I mean it. It will take some time. It will take at least a day to sign up all the things. So do not worry on those parts. And also the payment which you need to pay the deposit is directly to the property. You do not have to pay anything to us. Okay?\nSpeaker B: Okay. So could I please book the room?\nSpeaker A: Yes, yes, sure. So I have shared you some details. Sophie, can you please share it to me? The guarantor detail? I have shared your format. All you need to do is you need to share me the detail into those format so that I can process desired field. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: I have texted you on WhatsApp. You'll be able to see.\nSpeaker B: My guarantor. Probably had to be my dad.\nSpeaker A: I mean, it can be your dad. That's not an issue. It can be your dad. It can be your mom as well. Even if you have any sibling that are above 25 years of age that can also do.\nSpeaker B: This may take some time. Wait.\nSpeaker A: Absolutely. Absolutely. Sophie, do one thing. I. I mean, you don't need to be on call for a while. You can just fill out the detail and if I have anything that I need, I will ping you on WhatsApp directly and you can reply me back over there. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay then. Thank you.\nSpeaker A: You're welcome. Have a great day. Bye bye.\nSpeaker B: Bye bye.",
