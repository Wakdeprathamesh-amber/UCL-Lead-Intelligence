      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello?\nSpeaker B: Yeah. Hello, am I speaking?\nSpeaker A: Hello?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, Ravi, I. Rishabh the site calling you from Ambrose Student. Okay Ravi, I just wanted to confirm if you have decided anything with the student accommodation.\nSpeaker A: No, I haven't.\nSpeaker B: You have not decided it?\nSpeaker A: Yes, I've requested for a refund for the deposits that I put for Pavilion Court.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: And they told. And I have not signed the contract with them. So they're telling me somebody on the phone was telling me they would have to decide on my refund.\nSpeaker B: You can also let them know that you are ready to take the room if the contract is for 42 weeks. Not more than that. Only that's per. Even you don't visit the program. You can also let them know that you are ready to proceed. If the con. You can also let them know you can. You are ready to proceed.\nSpeaker A: To proceed. I don't want the room anymore. I'm not ready to proceed.\nSpeaker B: I don't want to just, just ask them for the.\nSpeaker A: Their service was terrible.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it is indeed. Should I share you some alternative options?\nSpeaker A: You said. Sorry, can I hear something? You said that if I had, if I said I'm booked with them they would reduce. Somebody told you on the phone that they would reduce my contract 51 weeks and that's why I booked with them. So when I booked with them they now changed their story and they said that oh, they're not able to reduce my contract from 51 weeks to 42 weeks so I would have to stay there for 51 weeks. So obviously that's not what I wanted and I usually know requested for a re for my refund back. But they said okay. Yeah, they would have to give a reason as to why I'm asking for a refund on my deposit back. What do you mean? They have to see the reason. That's very stupid. Like I, I think the reason is because I don't want to stay there. So why would they keep my, my deposit and not give it back to me? I have not signed anything. I have not signed the contract with them. Mind.\nSpeaker B: Absolutely. Absolutely. I thought the amount also hasn't been paid until you told me that you, you have made the payment. You told me that there was some click. You told me that there was some glitch and I haven't paid the deposit amount. So I went ahead with it. Then later you told me that you have also paid the deposit amount. So that is also. We need to confirm, get it done. But that's not an issue. They will be able to do so most probably. I don't think that this will take more time. Just give them a call by tomorrow. Hopefully it will. They will be able to sort this out. Okay. Or you can directly visit the property.\nSpeaker A: That they'll be able to give me back. You think they'll give me back my deposits?\nSpeaker B: I think so. There is a good chance that they will be able to do that. Meanwhile, you can do one thing here. You can. Since you are already in London. If you are, or you are, if you have someone here, I mean, in London, then you can directly ask them to reach the property once directly and then get it all sorted.\nSpeaker A: If I have somebody in London, I can ask them to go to the property.\nSpeaker B: Absolutely. That can be more done. Then they will be able to do everything.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Because like, you can see how I. I paid the deposit on the basis of. Oh, okay. My contract would be reduced. Right. So they can't tell. They can't change their mind after refused to give me back my deposit and I do not want to stay with them.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: Okay. So. Yeah. And is there a way for Amber students to reach out to Pavilion Court and explain this to them on behalf?\nSpeaker B: I mean. Yeah, but it will again take time. It will again take another two weeks or three weeks because they will not respond very soon. They will tell us the same thing. They will tell us the same thing. So it's better if you directly visit the property once and get this sorted. That that would be more good. Just send someone at the property, then let me know what's the status and then I'll be able to act accordingly. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Sorry, can you repeat yourself?\nSpeaker B: Yes. What I'm saying here is send someone at the property so that they can have a check and whatever the conclusion is, just let me know so that I can take the action accordingly. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay, that's fine. I'll keep you updated. Are you the one I'm chatting with on WhatsApp?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I am the one. Do not worry. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Oh, that's fine. I'll keep you updated accordingly. Thank you very much.",
