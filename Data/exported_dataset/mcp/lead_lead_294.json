      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello?\nSpeaker B: Hello. Hi, I'm speaking with Delisha. Yeah, Delisha, this is Rachana calling on behalf of University College London. Hi. I received your inquiry that you were looking for accommodation. Right?\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Right. May I know how can I help you?\nSpeaker A: I think I received an email about it. It's fine because now I've. I'm going to cancel my application. I'll look for private accommodation now.\nSpeaker B: Any specific reason about it?\nSpeaker A: Because I'm due to leave in about 15 days and I'm not a minor so I don't think I would have gotten it by the time I would have gotten into London.\nSpeaker B: I didn't get that, to be honest. You know, you're not a minor. That's okay. You are looking for an accommodation. So you're looking for specific to be private only or you're okay with student accommodations or university accommodations?\nSpeaker A: I applied for university accommodation initially.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: But I'm due to leave in 15 days and I had applied before the deadline but I received an email saying that they're only processing applications till the 17th of May right now. So I figured that by the time I would, I would have to prepare in advance because I'm an international student. So by the time I would be allotted accommodation, if at all I am guaranteed accommodation, it would be too late. So I looked into private accommodation and I'm waiting for confirmation from over there.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: So do you want to help from our end to be honest? Because I can suggest you some options. If you're looking for like a longer period or something like that.\nSpeaker A: I will let you know because I did find an accommodation, a private accommodation today and I'm waiting from confirmation on their end. So I've booked the place.\nSpeaker B: In London.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Oh wait, okay, I am calling from there itself. So you're. You're looking for South Bermont, London, you're looking for premium on suits, right?\nSpeaker A: Yes. Yes, correct.\nSpeaker B: You're looking for move in on the 13th of September, 51 weeks, 310 per week, correct?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, correct.\nSpeaker B: Okay, so that's exactly the same property we are talking about.\nSpeaker A: Okay. I thought you may be calling from the official student accommodation.\nSpeaker B: Just to confirm because you were looking for this. So what exactly? Because you said you're looking for the confirmation. So what exactly confirmation you're looking at as in to proceed and to send you the portal or something?\nSpeaker A: I don't know. Because today I looked at the website and it said that the confirmation is like maybe pending because it said that I've booked the place but I'm yet to Receive a confirmation or something like that.\nSpeaker B: No, actually what really happens is you know, whenever you short. So this, which you have done, that's like schedule like shortlisting a property. Okay. So you have shortlisted the property, you have filled in your details and everything. Correct. Now what we're going to do is from your, from our end is that you know, we would be making your portal, we would be sending you the credentials and the agreements, you would be signing ahead. You would be going ahead with all of the process. Right. And then you're looking at confirmation. So that's gonna happen when we're gonna process it for you. So I am calling you just to confirm that if you are like wanting to proceed with the same, I would be helping you with that right away. That's not an issue.\nSpeaker A: All right, kindly to go ahead then.\nSpeaker B: Okay, so just wanted to know that you know, you are wanting to pay in full or you wanting to pay in installments?\nSpeaker A: I will have to check with my parents and let you know.\nSpeaker B: Because if you want to proceed with installment, see for the process, we need this info. That's the whole point.\nSpeaker A: Yeah. Okay, Yeah. I will get back to you on it, no problem.\nSpeaker B: What I can do is, you know because for installments you would be needing a UK based guarantor. Right. And if you don't want to like provide any UK based guarantor, you still have an option of paying like the contract rate to be 20 pounds per week higher than the standard one and the installment plans would be termly.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: In case if you don't have a UK based guarantor. But if you do, then also it's fine. Are you currently in India or UK at the moment?\nSpeaker A: India.\nSpeaker B: India. Okay. And you're planning to go. Okay, you got your point.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay. I have anyway Dr. Your like WhatsApp message, you can look into it. Yeah.\nSpeaker A: So I have not received my visa yet. So I will be waiting on that. Yeah, yeah. If I do receive my visa and it does not allow me to fly before a certain date, then my, then the date on which I land could vary. But as for right now, I'm planning on landing on the 15th.\nSpeaker B: 15Th.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay. But the room availability is from 13 so rent gonna start from 13th. You can land on 15.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker B: That's fine, that's not an issue.\nSpeaker A: All right then yeah.\nSpeaker B: If you just inform me about, you know, the pro, I mean in the full site I can at least initiate in the portal for you so that at least the room is locked under you and I think the major concern which you have is regarding the vis. Right. Because we do have policy of no visa, no pay. Okay. Which allows you cancellation. What you really have to do by any chance the visa you cat or the offer letters are facing any difficulty. Right. You just have to notify the property, not to us, but to property that you know, this is the sole reason and I will not be able to make up. You know, God forbid that doesn't happen. But in case it does happen.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Every single money which you're paying gonna be returned back to you.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. All right.\nSpeaker A: So should I text you with the information about the installments or.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: Should I call you back on this number?\nSpeaker B: No, you can even text me back, you have my UK number now. And you can give me a call in the WhatsApp. If you want to give me a call on the same number, you can do that too.\nSpeaker A: All right, Perfect. Thank you.\nSpeaker B: No problem. Thank you so much. Looking forward for the same.\nSpeaker A: Thank you. Same. Have a good day.",
