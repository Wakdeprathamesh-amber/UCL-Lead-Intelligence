This call was regarding your student accommodation for University College London.\nSpeaker B: Yes, I.\nSpeaker A: Can see that you have shortlisted for Britannia Arlington Residents. Correct.\nSpeaker B: As what side?\nSpeaker A: I. I have seen that you have shortlisted one property by the name of go Britannia. I LinkedIn that correct?\nSpeaker B: I think so.\nSpeaker A: I just wanted to confirm if you wish to proceed ahead with the booking or like, do you wish to explore some other options as well?\nSpeaker B: I haven't heard back from the university, so I don't know.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so you haven't heard back from the UCL accommodation, is it?\nSpeaker B: No.\nSpeaker A: So do you wish to wait until you hear back or like, do you wish to proceed ahead with another student accommodation?\nSpeaker B: I'll wait and contact you later.\nSpeaker A: So I'll do one thing here. I'll connect you next week then. I'm hoping by that time you will have the confirmation whether you got the place or like you have to book a new student accommodation. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay, thank you. Thank you.\nSpeaker A: Bye bye.",
