I just kind of wanted to know a bit about what the policy is around that.\nSpeaker B: So there is a policy that if your place gets rejected at the university, we'll be able to provide you the refund. And along with that, if you are an international student and your visa gets rejected, we'll be able to provide you the refund.\nSpeaker A: Okay, cool. Okay, that sounds. That sounds good.
