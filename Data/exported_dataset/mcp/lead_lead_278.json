Yeah, hello.\nSpeaker C: Yes, hi and good afternoon.\nSpeaker D: I'm Anwar and calling from Amber.\nSpeaker A: Student.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I signed up for your wait list from Amber. Yeah, can you tell me about it?\nSpeaker A: Sure, sure.\nSpeaker C: So you're going to ucl, right?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I'm going to ucl. Like it's a conditional offer.\nSpeaker A: So it will confirmed on the 14th of August.\nSpeaker E: Okay.\nSpeaker C: And you have started to look for accommodations from now?\nSpeaker B: Yes, I have.\nSpeaker D: Okay, understood. And can you tell me like what's your per week budget like and what room type you're looking for?\nSpeaker C: Because I can see you have shortlisted.\nSpeaker D: A property on a website called Mannequin House.\nSpeaker A: So.\nSpeaker E: I'm Ayan's father. Okay.\nSpeaker A: So.\nSpeaker E: So I am will be staying with his mother. So these two, two of them are going to stay there. Okay, so okay.\nSpeaker C: So like Ayan and his mother, both.\nSpeaker D: Of them will stay there. Okay, understood.\nSpeaker C: So like will his mom stay throughout.\nSpeaker D: The duration of the.\nSpeaker A: Maybe not. Maybe not.\nSpeaker E: But initially for a few months she will be staying there.\nSpeaker A: Okay, understood. Got it.\nSpeaker D: So okay then I'll check for properties which allow dependencies also to stay on the properties.\nSpeaker C: Because most of our properties are student only accommodation. So they usually don't allow guests to.\nSpeaker D: Stay for more than three days who are non students. So I'll just quickly check the properties we have in London which currently allows.\nSpeaker A: Dependencies and I'll share them with you.\nSpeaker D: So in the meantime can you tell.\nSpeaker C: Me around how much budget you are.\nSpeaker A: Looking for and so what, what do.\nSpeaker E: You think like for average how much it will be like in four months? Private room. Private room, private kitchen and bathroom.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker D: So for a studio the prices currently.\nSpeaker C: In London averages between 300, 350, 360 and it goes up to a good.\nSpeaker A: Like 1500 per month.\nSpeaker D: So the starting is around 350, 360 per week.\nSpeaker E: Okay. I think should be okay. Should be okay. So you can suggest us a couple of options. Okay, sure.\nSpeaker D: So I'll just check with the supply team and I'll get back to you in some time with properties that we have for dependencies.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, and another thing is that our priority would be a bit for a bigger one. It doesn't matter if it's a bit like far from the campus. Like 30 minutes is okay.\nSpeaker A: Not so far.\nSpeaker B: Not so far but around 32. It doesn't not. It does not have to be like.\nSpeaker A: A 5 minute walk or 10 minute walk.\nSpeaker B: It can be like a bit further.\nSpeaker A: Like 30 minutes tube or 20 minutes tube.\nSpeaker E: Understood.\nSpeaker A: Got it, got it.\nSpeaker B: And another thing. Yeah. Budget around that seems fine to us. Like, up to, like, £400 per week is our maximum. And 350.\nSpeaker A: 350.\nSpeaker B: At 350.\nSpeaker A: 353. 350 is good.\nSpeaker C: Yeah.\nSpeaker E: Okay.\nSpeaker A: Understood. Got it, got it.\nSpeaker C: So just allow me sometime. I'll let you know and if.\nSpeaker A: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you.",

So this is Andrew Anand from Amber Student.\nSpeaker A: Yes. Yes.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, hi. So we checked with a few properties and like unfortunately none of them allows dependencies. Like only. They only allow up to five nights. That is the maximum they can offer. So then how to do so student accommodations don't allow like parents or anyone else to see who are not students. So that can only be accommodated by. By private housing flats or something like that.\nSpeaker A: So do you, do you help in that?\nSpeaker B: No, no, we unfortunately have only student accommodations.\nSpeaker A: So in student accommodation also I saw you, you guys have flat. The sleds are for family and couples.\nSpeaker B: No, no, no, no, no. Those are only for students on our website. Whichever, whatever flat you saw, those are only for students because the accommodations don't allow non students to stay in the properties. So.\nSpeaker A: So you can't help in.\nSpeaker B: Yes, that's the case. I tried reaching out to multiple property managements but they said the five nights we cannot accommodate for a few months.\nSpeaker A: So what do you suggest? Like how do we go about it?\nSpeaker B: You can look for private accommodations. Like there are multiple. Like for example private rental flat which most students book. Who wants to say with their. No parents Mostly because we have had multiple cases where the students parents stays with them for a few months. So you can go look. You can you know look for one bedroom apartments there which are not student accommodation. But like with anyone can book. Okay.\nSpeaker A: So private. So I have to go with the rent X or other websites.\nSpeaker B: Yes, like maybe. I mean we don't like book private accommodations so. But private accommodations do allow like families and couples or anyone else to see.\nSpeaker A: All right, all right. So I look forward to other website for.\nSpeaker B: Right, sure.
