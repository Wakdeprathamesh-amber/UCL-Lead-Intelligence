Hi Aman, this is Arushi from Amber Student, the official accommodation partner for University College Bandon. How are you?\nSpeaker B: I'm okay, how are you?\nSpeaker A: I'm good as well. So I'll be helping you book your student accommodation near your university. I just wanted to know. This is September intake, right?\nSpeaker B: This is September intake.\nSpeaker A: Okay. And do you want the accommodation for 51 weeks which is almost a year?\nSpeaker B: No.\nSpeaker A: Then may I know the duration that you want it for?\nSpeaker B: I was looking for like 39. 40. 41.\nSpeaker A: Okay. So I think very few would be available for 39 weeks. Most of them would be available for 44 weeks, but still we'll have a look at the ones that are available for 39 as well. And do you have any room type preference? Like would you need a private room with the private washroom and shared kitchen which is the ensuite? Or you want all things private or are you comfortable in sharing the room or the washroom?\nSpeaker B: I'm sorry, just to. Just to cut you off. I've already found some accommodation so yeah, I won't be needing it anymore.\nSpeaker A: Okay, you've already found it. May I know how? Like did you book it on campus or have you booked a private accommodation?\nSpeaker B: It's on campus.\nSpeaker A: Okay, got it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Bye Bye.",
