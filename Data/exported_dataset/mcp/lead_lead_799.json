I guess I'm calling you from Ambit Student, the official accommodation partner for University College London students.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: I can see that you have sent the booking form for two of the properties that you have. The first one is the gardening, of course, London. And the other one I can see here is Captain Holly Crescent. So can you please confirm which property that you wish to proceed with?\nSpeaker B: So, actually, when I was looking at it, I was. I didn't realize that it would go through to the booking, so I haven't actually decided yet, but I didn't look like there was any way to cancel what I'd already done, so.\nSpeaker A: Actually, the booking hasn't been processed for any of them. I see. I think that you have shown interest. I just wanted to confirm, like, which will be your top choice for the accommodation so that I can get to, you know, reserve a group.\nSpeaker B: So, like, I. I haven't quite decided, so would it be possible to, for the moment, just. Just cancel them?\nSpeaker A: Would you. Would you like to have any suggestions for the same.\nSpeaker B: Pardon?\nSpeaker A: Would you like to have any suggestions from my end, like, which properties should. Sorry, could you just rep. Yes. What I'm saying here is, would you like to have some suggestions? Like what. Which property should you choose from my end? I'll do one thing here, Melinda. I'll connect you one more step. Will that be okay for you? I suppose that the network line is not very good, even.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, that would be better. Thank you.",

So I'm going to have a look at those first just because they're a little bit cheaper and then if I can't find anything there, I will have a look at the ones.\nSpeaker A: So I can do one thing here. I can found you some accommodation which are a bit cheaper in price and also can schedule the leave. So I'll do one thing here. I'll give you a text on WhatsApp. Just let me know which property that you wish to view and then you'll be able to view the property along with that lower price. Will that be okay with you?\nSpeaker B: So I've got. I've. I've got some other properties that I'm looking to view before.
