      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello? Yeah, hello, am I speaking with Chongji here? Yeah, hello Rishabh, the site calling you from AMB Student. Go on. Yeah, so Chong, I just wanted to confirm here. I can see that you have filled the booking form for Moonraker Point, correct? Yeah. So just wanted to confirm which kind of payment plan that you wish to proceed with. Because this property offers forced installment without a UK based guarantor. So means that anyone from your family, be it your father or mother, can become the guarantor for you and you can pay the rent in for installment or either. The second option is upfront payment, means that you have to pay for the whole amount of weeks upfrontly before moving in into the property. So which payment method that you want to go for? Not decided. I think we just started looking today. We have not decided on which one we want to go with. I think it's too, too soon for us to be deciding on the payment method. Okay, so let me tell you one thing here. Majority of the properties are already being sold out. I'll do one thing here. I'll share you some more option with the same price range along with a good location, good property, good reviews on your WhatsApp so that you will have sufficient time to explore the other options as well. Okay. Yeah, the budget would be. Yeah, please tell me, go ahead. Can I tell you like my preferences for like. Yes, yes, please, please, please, please, please. I would prefer a private bathroom and one that's near ucl. Okay. And what about the kitchen? Sharing kitchen is fine. Yeah. And what's the budget that you'll be looking for? 350. 350. Got it, got it. 350 pounds. Yeah, that can work. And 350 pounds. And along with that you're looking for a 44 weeks tenancy or 51 weeks tenants. 44, 44 weeks. Okay, so just allow me some time to get this checked and then I will share you the option very soon. Okay. Can I, can I just ask right, these studios or these units that we have seen, they are all in an apartment, right? So if it's shared kitchen is usually shared with how many other students? On an average basis the number of sharing kitchen is 4 to 5. In some cases it is 6 to 7 as well. Okay, so I will try to find your property, either an ensuite because see I can also try to find you a studio room where everything will be private. Beat room, washroom, kitchen. But that can be slightly higher to 350. It can be 400 or 420. So I'll do one thing here. I'll check all the available option. If I'm able to find any studio rooms as well within the price range of your, I will share that to you as well. Okay. Okay. See, the average number here is four to five students. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll be sharing you the options very soon on your WhatsApp. Okay. Thank you. Welcome to Papa. Hi.",
