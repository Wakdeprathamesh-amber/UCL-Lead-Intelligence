So may I know which university are you proceeding ahead?\nSpeaker B: Sorry, but I do not need any accommodation. I was looking for a short term accommodation and I think you misunderstood it.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Short term. We do have short term also available. May I know the preferred duration for yourself?\nSpeaker B: But it's fine. Since I never got a reply. I already found another one.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Like how long you would like to stay? Only for a three to four weeks.\nSpeaker B: Sorry, I already got the accommodation. It's all good.\nSpeaker A: Okay. So is it a private or a student accommodation?\nSpeaker B: It's a student accommodation.\nSpeaker A: Okay. May I know which property have you booked?\nSpeaker B: Why?\nSpeaker A: Just. Just wanted to check like whether you got some cash back or not. Because at this point of time most of the property is offering some cash back and the discount and all. So that is the reason. I can also like check it.\nSpeaker B: No, thank you. All good. Thank you.\nSpeaker A: No worries. Yes. Bye. Bye.",
