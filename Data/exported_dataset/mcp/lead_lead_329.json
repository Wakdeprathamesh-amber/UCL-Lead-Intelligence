      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello?\nSpeaker B: Hello?\nSpeaker A: Hello? Wait, wait, wait, wait a bit. Hello? Can you hear me?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, I can hear you. Can you hear me?\nSpeaker A: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yep, continue. Yep.\nSpeaker B: Okay. This is Rachna calling on behalf of University College London. We received your inquiry that you were looking for accommodation.\nSpeaker A: Paran.\nSpeaker B: You were looking for accommodation. Yep. Yeah. So we received an inquiry on behalf of University College London and we wanted to connect with you regarding the same. So may I know that what exactly you're looking at and what is your preferences that are going to help you with the same?\nSpeaker A: Sorry, can you repeat again?\nSpeaker B: I'm sure I'll speak a bit slow.\nSpeaker A: I'm saying can you speak a bit slower please? Your pace is a bit too quick for me, I apologize.\nSpeaker B: No problem. That's okay. I'll just speak up very slowly and you know, to help you with that. Just wanted to know that you are looking for accommodation, right?\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Right. And do you have a preference of regarding the rooms or maybe a budget so that I can help you with that?\nSpeaker A: I would like to ask if there's any extra accommodation because like I'm 10 to UCL through clearing and I didn't receive any invitation about accommodation. So is there any chance for me to still apply or I can like here in a waiting list, things like that, or I have to do like, apply like price accommodation now because like the accommodation UCL is full already.\nSpeaker B: So if I'm not wrong, you're looking for the accommodation for ucl, right?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker B: And I'm calling on behalf of that itself. So just to know, just to understand what exactly is your preference that you're looking at? Wait, I mean, okay, okay, I'll be, I'll be more slow. Do you have a preference like, do you have like a room preference in your mind or do you have a budget preference or do you have, you know, like, like, you know, a specific thing in your mind that I want this kind of accommodation, Maybe I want this kind of room, maybe I want a private kitchen, maybe I want a private washroom. So do have you. Do you have something like that in your mind?\nSpeaker A: Probably like private bathroom and private bed, like, but I don't mind if this is share kitchen and it would probably be the best if the accommodation is near the campus. Yep.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Okay, sounds good. So you want something which is close to your university, right?\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And do you have a budget preference? Like, do you have some, some budget.\nSpeaker A: How, like what is the range for the. All the accommodation in ucl, like for the price?\nSpeaker B: Okay, yeah, yeah, that's a Good question. So basically if you are looking for the accommodations which are like not that far away, like you know, like 30, 35 minutes by bus or train. Right. The properties are available for a starting of three, like 280 per week. So. 280, 290. These are the availability at the moment. Okay, so it's like a private room, private washroom, the kitchen has to be shared. It's a 51 weeks contract and you can move in for like four 51 weeks and you will get the best of the premium rooms available. And you know, these are like very good properties. And if I tell you about the distance, the distance is like 30 minutes by bus or train, or even if you take a drive, it's gonna take you like 20, 25 minutes. So that's the availability we have at the moment. Close to ucl.\nSpeaker A: Yes. Is there any like still any space for me if it is the location like within 45 minutes walking distance? Because I prefer like just. I'm not really trusting the tfl, you know, like they always cancel train. Like so I'm. I prefer like the walking distance will be within 45 minutes. That would be the best.\nSpeaker B: Okay, so you want something which is like maximum 45 minutes per walk, right?\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Okay, got that. And do you have like a specific per month range which you are like looking like 1200, 1300 pounds or 1500 at the max, you know, like, like.\nSpeaker A: A maximum budget which you're looking at not exceeding 400.\nSpeaker B: Not exceeding 400?\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: 400 a week, right?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, under 400 a week. That will be fine.\nSpeaker B: Sounds good. Sounds good. I mean I can definitely give you some great options. Let me just have a quick check because you want something like, you know, walkable of 45 minutes. Let me see if I can give you. Yeah, I mean would you also be comfortable if I give you like a twin studio or a twin ensuite? Like you know, two people, but you have your private room and this washroom has to be shared with one other person or the kitchen has to be shared with one other person. Are you like comfortable in something like that also?\nSpeaker A: How many people do I need to share with?\nSpeaker B: Just one.\nSpeaker A: Just one. So there's no private room for that?\nSpeaker B: I mean one of the property, which I'm checking that doesn't have. But you know, that's like two minutes from the university. That was the whole reason. But what I can do.\nSpeaker A: Two minutes walk?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, two minutes.\nSpeaker A: Two minutes walk. That sounds great. If I just share with one people.\nSpeaker B: I mean, you know, if you. How Much.\nSpeaker A: Sorry, yeah, you can continue. Continue.\nSpeaker B: I was just saying that you know, in the same property which is like two minutes away. If you also want to do like whole of the private space. Right. That gonna cost you like almost 600, 700 a week. You know that's gonna be lot. So if you want a private space, we do have that. But if you want to like share, I mean if you're okay with sharing. Okay. We do have availability from 365 also like a week for 51.\nSpeaker A: Yeah. Do I, do I need to make a decision now or is there any way for me to like like outside discuss with my parents and I can give the answer for you? So where, which way? Like which way can I give the answer back to you? Because like I didn't do the application like on the accommodation portal. So I'm thinking about how to do. Yeah, that responds to you.\nSpeaker B: That's fine. You know what I can do for you? What I can do for you? I can actually share some options with you on the WhatsApp. Okay. I do have some amazing options, you know, fitting your budget to be honest and which are like even 30 minutes at the maximum walk not even 45. And it's like a private studios available. So it would be a private room, private kitchen and a private washroom in like353,90 per week. Okay. You can look forward for the options. Even the bills are inclusive so you don't have to worry on those factors. Right. Yeah, and I'll share that with you. You can go through it and you know, you can let me know if you like any of it. We can definitely discuss about that in detail. Or if you feel that, you know, give me like more options, I'll be happy to share more options with you.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, so you can share the information in WhatsApp for me, right?\nSpeaker B: Yeah. But do you use the Same number on WhatsApp by any chance?\nSpeaker A: I do have numbers. But you do like a non UK numbers or you must have a UK number for WhatsApp.\nSpeaker B: Is it like 776-05-69335?\nSpeaker A: Yes, this is my mobile number but I apparently don't have like WhatsApp for this number. So you can only share. Yeah, so you can share like for the overseas number or you can say that you can only do WhatsApp on UK number.\nSpeaker B: I can actually send you an email also. That's fine. But just wanted to know, you know, WhatsApp would be easy for have a quick answers and questions for both of us, isn't it?\nSpeaker A: Sure. Can you share whatsapps to this number?\nSpeaker B: Like I mean or.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, you can see it.\nSpeaker B: I was just wanting to know that. Which number do you use for WhatsApp? That I can drop a quick hi.\nSpeaker A: It is a Hong Kong number.\nSpeaker B: Okay, you can let me know about it. Fine.\nSpeaker A: Oh, eight, number nine three, eight, one.\nSpeaker B: One second.
