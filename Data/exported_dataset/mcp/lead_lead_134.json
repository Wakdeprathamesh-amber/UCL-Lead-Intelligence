      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello, I'm her brother, I'm a brother here.\nSpeaker B: Oh actually the staple is regarding the student accommodation.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Yes.\nSpeaker B: Hello, Hello.\nSpeaker A: Yes, I mean I made the request actually. Yeah, got it, got it, got it.\nSpeaker B: Got it, got it. Have you checked any option? I can see that you have finalized one property here. I can see London as canvas wals two. So just wanted to.\nSpeaker A: That was one. I haven't, Yeah, I haven't checked in detail actually. Okay. So I, I, I let you know my, my requirement probably you can advise better.\nSpeaker B: Yes.\nSpeaker A: Okay. So she'll be starting masters at the UCL mainly in the Bloomsbury campus. Okay. And then it's for one year so 51 weeks. So I'm looking for accommodation where she can easily travel to the UCL campus and the budget is around 250 to 280 range or you've got cheaper, better as well. But yeah, so what kind of room.\nSpeaker B: Preference that they have?\nSpeaker A: Okay, the room like a shared kitchen and things is fine. It's just that must be able, must be able to cook means like a shared kitchen is fine and then a shared toilet is also fine as long as the room is comfortable enough.\nSpeaker B: Like who is going to stay there? Like your brother or sister?\nSpeaker A: No, no, she, sister. Sister.\nSpeaker B: Okay, so she must be needing a female contract shared washing flat then. Correct.\nSpeaker A: Sorry, what's that? Couldn't you.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, so what I'm saying here is like since she will be going, so she will be needing a property which has a female sensing chromatoid if she is going to change the washroom. Correct?\nSpeaker A: Yes. Preferably female if it is, if it is mixed is fine as well. No issues as long as the, the tenants are all either professionals or students. Like not.\nSpeaker B: No, no, we only deal, we only deal in student accommodation. So there will be no.\nSpeaker A: Okay, okay, okay, that's better.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. And what about the guarantor plan? What about the payable plan that you are thinking to pay? Do you wish to pay the rental installment or do you wish, do you have the funds in one go? How is it?\nSpeaker A: No, we'll prefer installment and then for guarantor I think UCL can give the current of, right?\nSpeaker B: Yep. Okay, so I have two properties in mind at the moment. The first one is iq, the arcade. That is a pretty popular property going among the UCU students since it's only 2.8 miles from Bloomsbury campus available.\nSpeaker A: Sorry, sorry, can you repeat again slowly because I cannot hear your voice.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, so. So there is one property by the name of. And it's only 2.8 miles from the UCL Bloomsbury.\nSpeaker A: Okay, what's the name? IQ. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: I think I saw the property.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. I will share with the option. Do not worry, I will share it to you on the WhatsApp and the email. So this property is offering a four installment without a UK based guarantor. Means you can become the guarantor for your sister. That is not an issue. Okay, second thing, it's the nearest property that you can get with a range of 250 to 270 range. Third thing, this property is offering a 750 pounds of cash flow. So that's a huge cash. Okay, how much? How much?\nSpeaker A: You said per month?\nSpeaker B: No, per week. The price of per week is 259 pounds for the corporate room. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: 43 weeks. For 43 weeks if she wish to go 50, 51 weeks. The room type is silver room. Plus that the price for that is 269 pounds still. Well and then there is a one time cashback for the property that is 750 pounds.\nSpeaker A: Okay. And then like how, how far is it from UCL and how was the transportation?\nSpeaker B: 2.8 miles.\nSpeaker A: 2.8 miles roughly. How long will it take by 2:20 minutes. Okay, what is the nearest station to the.\nSpeaker B: I mean it's near located nearby the city center. So it's like the nearest tube will be walking distance.\nSpeaker A: Oh, so it's located near to Paddington.\nSpeaker B: Yes, it's on the Holloway road.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so like she can just, just walk also to the university.\nSpeaker B: No, no, I mean if she wish to then she can. But walking will take time because it's 2.8 miles below. So I'll prefer tube in that case. And it's located on the Holloway road where the tube is available all the time and the tube like walking.\nSpeaker A: So this is zone what actually what zone is this?\nSpeaker B: Zone one and two between.\nSpeaker A: Okay Ken, and what was the other option is the option that I saw with the London Nest or something.\nSpeaker B: That will be a bit far from the University of yours. That is seven miles from UCL Bloomsbury. Triple the distance from IQ the arcade. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: And it will, it will also take. It will also take like 25 to 30 minutes via two because there is a direct view from the property room. That's the upper hand that it's an ensuite room means that she don't have to share the washroom. She can get the private room, private washroom and the kitchen. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay. So. So the advantage is more towards the comfort law which is like it's A N suit, right?\nSpeaker B: Yes. Actually there is one another property group. Group called London. They have a studio available and also a cashback of £500. It means that she can basically she can move in into the property. And it's a student. Your room. She will get the room. She will get the washroom. She will get the kitchen. And the price is £250.\nSpeaker A: How much was it?\nSpeaker B: £250. £250.\nSpeaker A: Okay that. That sounds better. So that. That's a better option, is it?\nSpeaker B: Yes, it is a better option.\nSpeaker A: But how far is it?\nSpeaker B: 4.8 months.\nSpeaker A: But if used to cube is like almost the same timing or less than 30 minutes.\nSpeaker B: The timing timing will be same. It's not much.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: That's. That's nice actually. Okay. Can you WhatsApp me the details?\nSpeaker B: Probably I have done that. I have shared you all the three properties that we are discussing over the course. So that you can just check all the option and come to a conclusion. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Just if you don't mind just highlight to me which one that you. You told in the last.\nSpeaker B: The.\nSpeaker A: The insured.\nSpeaker B: Something like the last option.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: It's Sunlight Apartment. The name of the property department.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Okay. Okay Ken. Then I'll. I'll take a look into that and then I will confirm with you. So how about the deposit?\nSpeaker B: The deposit is like 100 to 100 and 100 to 120 pounds. Or like 200.\nSpeaker A: 200 pound deposit. So there's no deposit. The guarantor can be outsiders also Or Unity can be the guarantor.\nSpeaker B: Every property have a different character. Guarantee requirements like IQ do not require a UK based guarantor. London with the property which you selected also does not require a UK based guarantor. But the property which I'm going to share you. Brook Hall. Brookhole. 250 pound. What does require a guarantor?\nSpeaker A: Okay. But. But if they require a guarantor we can use UCL as the guarantor, right?\nSpeaker B: Yes. Yes. Yes. UCL does provide.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Can. That's good. So I'll check on the.\nSpeaker B: What?\nSpeaker A: Check on the WhatsApp and then I'll confirm it.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Sure.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Sorry. May I know what you need? Sorry. Rishabh, is it?\nSpeaker B: Yes.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Okay. Thanks. I'll get you get back to you. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.",
