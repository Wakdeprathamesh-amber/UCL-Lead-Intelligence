This call will be recorded for training and quality purposes. Thank you for contacting Amber. Please wait while we connect you to our support executive.\nSpeaker B: Thank you for contacting Amber. Student. My name is Khushi, how can I assist you today?\nSpeaker A: Oh, hello. My son has been offered his place at UCL starting in September. He has been offered accommodation through UCL and we've been to see it today and literally he said he won't go to UCL if he goes there, it's miles away. So I'm just wondering what type of, what do you have available at the moment? Because he needs to be close to ucl. However, his campus is going to be at Canary Wharf. So I want it to be a decent journey for him because. Yeah, because if you can imagine where I'm coming from, he said he's going to be in Canary Wharf and they put, put him out in the back beyond which. Okay, which is not ucl, it's just one could get the UCL experience at all.\nSpeaker B: I don't know what you've got for.\nSpeaker A: A one bedroom ensuite.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: And ensuite.\nSpeaker B: Okay, sure. We would be glad to assist you. For your son, may I just have a few basic preferences of such as what would be his move in date and what would be the duration of his stay?\nSpeaker A: His move? Well, the term starts on the. Sorry, I'm all over the place. With everything going on at the moment, I was a bit shocked. Everyone saw the thing. Term starts on the terms. Yeah, term starts on Monday the 22nd, but we'd like to get in, you know, maybe the week before or the Friday before, which would be the next.\nSpeaker B: Week is what you're saying.\nSpeaker A: No, the week before which would be around Friday the 19th September.\nSpeaker B: Okay, understood. 19th September.\nSpeaker A: And then up until now term ends on Friday 12 June, but we're flexible.\nSpeaker B: Okay, understood. So like a contract about like 44, 42.\nSpeaker A: Well, actually the proper term is. I've actually got it here. The proper term that we were originally looking at with UCL was I think it was 30, 39 weeks.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: But we have flexibility there if we're limited.\nSpeaker B: Okay, understood, understood. All right. And do you have any budget preferences as well?\nSpeaker A: You know what, I'm so panicky now, I think we could go off.\nSpeaker B: No, no, I think I understand your situation. I'm so sorry to bother you and you know, bombard you with all of these. No, no, no, it's good, it's good, it's good.\nSpeaker A: I mean, ideally I don't want to pay more than £500 a week. And that's literally, that is our, I mean, I, I literally, I'm using savings for that.\nSpeaker B: Okay, understood. I've noted that requirement down as well. So what I do is I just, you know, we have a specialized booking experience efforts and they are directly coordinating with the property. So they would go ahead and they would share some properties with you, aligning with all your preferences that you just shared with me over the call. And all I would need is your son's email address and your son's full name or even you can provide your details if that's okay. They'll share the property options with you.\nSpeaker A: Oh, no, share it with me. At the moment that's probably the best thing. His name is Harry. His name is Harry Evans. E B B A N S. But if you put everything through to Evan's family in the first instance. So it's ebb a n s a n s family.\nSpeaker B: Yes.\nSpeaker A: @Icloud.Com.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And his name is Harry. Right. H A double I. Is that right?\nSpeaker A: That's right, yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay, understood. Thank you so much for sharing the preferences with me.\nSpeaker A: Thank you.\nSpeaker B: So I have gone ahead and notified one of our dedicated booking experts. They would be. You can expect them to reach out to you within 24 hours or even prior to that.\nSpeaker A: Okay, great. Okay. Is this quite normal? Are you getting loads of calls now from all these first year students?\nSpeaker B: Yes. So it's currently the season period that has begun for us. So we are having a lot of inflow of students, you know, that want to book with us and we keep on getting calls about the same regarding accommodation.
