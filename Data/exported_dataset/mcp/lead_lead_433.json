      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hi.\nSpeaker B: Hi.\nSpeaker A: Antonina, this is Arushi from Amber Student. How are you?\nSpeaker B: Okay. From where?\nSpeaker A: Sorry, this is Arushi from Amber Student, partnered with University College London.\nSpeaker B: Yes. Yes.\nSpeaker A: Hello. Hi. Yes, so I'll be helping you book your student accommodation in London and I can see that you already like a property called Grandfather House London and. Right?\nSpeaker B: Yes.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so let me tell you how far this is from your university first and then we can discuss it in detail.\nSpeaker B: Okay. So I'm sorry, I haven't booked it yet though. I have just tried to book it. I started booking it. Sorry, I haven't booked anything yet. I just started doing the process but I haven't booked it yet.\nSpeaker A: Okay. Yeah. So I will be helping you in the booking procedure. Have you finalized any room type that you want to book at this property?\nSpeaker B: No, I guess. No. No, I haven't decided between the 235 per week and the 275 per week.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so let me.\nSpeaker B: One of them has a private bathroom, I guess. Yes.\nSpeaker A: So let me tell you the difference. So there's a two bed apartment which means a private room with a shared bathroom and shared kitch kitchen just that you will share. There will be one bathroom that will be shared between two students and there will be one kitchen that will be shared between just the two of you. And the price for that is 235 GBP per week. Okay. That is for 51 weeks starting from the 13th of September. And then there's another five bed ensuite where you have a private room with the private bathroom and the kitchen will be shared with other four students. So it will be the five of you sharing and the price for that is 275 GBP. And okay, so it totally. It totally depends on you whether you're comfortable in sharing the bathroom with one student. If yes, then you can go with the 235 one because that is more economical. But if you want a private bathroom and you're comfortable in sharing the kitchen with more people, you know, then you should definitely go for the five bed ensuite.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And there is also one that two bedroom and the other one that's three bedroom. The three bedroom one.\nSpeaker A: Is.\nSpeaker B: Is it like one bathroom for three people? Yes, exactly.\nSpeaker A: Exactly. You got it right. That's one bathroom shared between three people and one shared between three people.\nSpeaker B: Do you know? Maybe you don't. Do you know why it's like the same prices for two people or is the kitchen much bigger or what corner?\nSpeaker A: Let, let me see. So the room size for two bed apartment is at 8.9.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And for three bed apartment, it's 8.71 to 10.1 square meter. So it has the square meters also. Oh, what's the square meters of room? Okay, I can see that the square meters are for the.\nSpeaker A: Yes. So for the two, for the two bed apartment, the size is 8.70 square meter to 8.79 square meter.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: And for the three bed apartment it's almost same. It's 8.71 to 10 square meter. Okay. So I'm. I don't know why the price is same. Let me check it. Something must be there.\nSpeaker B: Just a minute. Oh, I can actually see. I haven't seen that before, but I can actually see that there is no wardrobe in the rooms or.\nSpeaker A: No. So basically every room has a wardrobe. Okay. So your room will, will be a fully furnished room where you will have a bed, a study desk and chair and a wardrobe that's that is compulsory for every room. Be it two bedroom apartment, three bed apartment, or five bed on suit.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: These four because. Yeah, yeah, that might, that maybe because it might be right next to the door. Okay. Right at the entrance. That could be the case.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And I just wanted to ask another question would be this, what else I had as a question? Yes. So this apartment.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Is it like how do I know who I'm gonna share it with? Do you guys base it on age or just on availability or how. Because you base it on postgraduate, undergraduate, the same university or you just don't have any of this?\nSpeaker A: So it is, it is actually based out on availability. It is done very randomly. That is the property. They, they keep it very confidential as to whom will be put with which student. As in which student will be shared by which, like which block will be shared by which students. So that is very confidential. So we do not have any idea of like it will be postgraduate students or it will be undergrad students. It is that. It is that way.\nSpeaker B: What about, sorry, what about women or men or mixed or is that some kind of preference we can have or.\nSpeaker A: No, no, you can have that preference that, that, that you can totally have. So we can put that additional request that please put our students with all females in a block where there are all females. So suppose the 5 bed ensuite is there. Right. So we can put the request that please put these five, the student with in a block where there are all four other females. That can be done.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker A: And if they have the availability, they can do it.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Well, yes, well, yeah, I Don't have any questions really. But I, I haven't decided yet. So I would need some time to decide. But I'm on my process of deciding.\nSpeaker A: No, no worries. You can. Do you want me to tell you a little about the amenities?\nSpeaker B: I also want to know a bit like is the pictures realistic? So those pictures that I'm seeing, are they like made out like AI generated or is it that it's realistic?\nSpeaker A: No, no, no, no. These are, these are not AI generated pictures. These are live pictures that were taken from a camera. So, you know, basically the bed sheets need to be bought by you. They will provide you with a mattress. So when you, when you go to your room, the only difference between your room and this room is that you will get a clear, very empty room. As in, there will be no bed sheet and no pictures. And then it is up to you how you decorate it. But these are actually real time pictures. These are not AI generated pictures. So that's exactly how the room would look in terms of furniture.\nSpeaker B: Okay, next question would be do you guys have some kind of garden, like outside or something?\nSpeaker A: Yes.\nSpeaker B: So.\nSpeaker A: Yes. So this property, from what I can see, it has an exclusive landscape courtyard. So that is like a, that is I guess a nice garden right outside the property. And other, it has some really other great amenities, like it has cinema room with free netflix, it has free on set gym. It even has a free sauna and steam room. This property also has a free on site swimming pool. Yeah, they have pool tables, they have table tennis table. Yeah, so. And then they have arcade machines. So in London this is one of the best properties, even in my eyes because this is really a rare property which has swimming pool. Otherwise I have not seen any other property with a swimming pool, to be honest.\nSpeaker B: I just need to. Is it, do you know in which zone is that? Or like which, which zone? Because I, I looked at it.\nSpeaker A: Yes, one minute. I'll tell you in which zone this one is. So it's in the fourth zone. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Yes.\nSpeaker A: Yes.\nSpeaker B: Okay, so this one.\nSpeaker A: Yes.\nSpeaker B: Yes. Just one second. I just want to double check how far away it is because I remember it was comparably good with public transport to UCL. Because I'm gonna study in UCL. But.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so from the city center, this is 40 minutes away by bus and let me check how far it is from UCL. Just a minute.\nSpeaker B: It's. It says 30 minutes.\nSpeaker A: Sorry, how much?\nSpeaker B: I think it's 30 minutes, but I'm not sure.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: Okay, then that's, that's nice. Because, see, 90% of the students in London travel for one hour. One hour, 15 minutes. One way, too, because the. Their property is in one zone, their universities in another, and London is pretty expensive, so a lot of students can't afford it. So that's why they have to travel a lot. So, I mean, if it's just 30 minutes, that's great.\nSpeaker B: Yes. Yeah. There is one that it's one hour away, but my guess is that I'm not gonna go start building that much. So it's okay.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Okay. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Let's do one thing. Okay, so let's do one thing. Let me share this property with you on WhatsApp and Mailboat. And if you have any more questions, you can let me know on WhatsApp so that I will answer your questions right there. And if your parents even want to talk to me about this, if they have any questions, I'll be happy to. Happy to answer their questions on a call. And then once you finally.\nSpeaker B: I am. I am 28 years old and. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: I'm so sorry. Got it.\nSpeaker B: You will be the.\nSpeaker A: I'm so sorry for that. Oh, no.\nSpeaker B: No problem. It's so good. I feel good to feel like I'm 18 or something. 17. So I just wanted to ask one more question. So I have a partner from, like, I, like, I live in Denmark and I have a partner who come once in a while. And the plan is like, for him to come every two weeks for extended weekend. So that's three days. So like six days a month. So what is the policy about how much? Because the University of UCL has the policy that the person can come and stay with you seven days a month. But I'm not sure what is the policy in that accommodation.\nSpeaker A: Okay, so from what, I guess, yeah, so it is written that you are allowed to have guests visiting you. So I think you can see from what I know your friends, like, there are students whose friends come and they stay at the property for two, three days. I don't know if for a stretch of seven days it will be allowed, but since he will be coming every two weeks, I think you can. This can be managed. Like, you can also you can talk about it at the reception. And I am sure if other students don't have a problem with it, the property management will also not have a problem with it because guests are allowed. It's written that it is your home, so you are allowed to have guests. That's written. So technically guests are allowed. So I'm sure he can visit You?\nSpeaker B: Yes. So like he's not gonna like live with me because we have a place in Copenhagen. But like I said, he will be a guest every few weeks. And yeah, it's also like of course if I'm with woman only property then it will be hard if they don't want the person to come. So it's a bit, so it's a bit confusing because we're not going to be able to connect with those people before I go to live there. Right. Is that correct? Yeah, I wouldn't know who I'm gonna be with or any of that.\nSpeaker A: That is really not possible. So if you feel that the other person would be uncomfortable, then you should go for the five bed ensuite because there you have your private room with your private bathroom.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: So even you and your partner both will be comfortable that way I guess because you know, even your partner would like to have a bathroom that is shared by you. Only instead, if you go for a three bed apartment, suppose your partner comes and then it will be the two other students and then it will be you and your partner as well sharing that one washroom. So technically it is better that you go for the five pair on suit. Keeping that thing in mind. But still if you're, you can, you can have a talk about this to your partner if he's comfortable, if he, she is comfortable in sharing it, the washroom then you can go for any of the two bed or the three bed apartment.\nSpeaker B: Okay, well, that's about it. I don't think I really have any more questions from now on. Maybe like is there anything. I mean I have the website so I can see. So you guys are. Because I found it in the UCL website. Like there is some kind of like. So you have a partnership with ucl, is that correct?\nSpeaker A: Yes, yes, yes, we are partnered with ucl. So I have a question at this point. You. You are based out of uk. Like ah, basically you are based out of uk. I mean because this property requires a UK based guarantor.\nSpeaker B: Huh. Well I, yeah, I can find a UK guarantor but I, I live in Denmark and I'm based in Denmark but.\nSpeaker A: I have set of status in the uk.\nSpeaker B: But yeah, I live in Denmark so.\nSpeaker A: Okay, but you can find a UK based character then that is not a problem because if you, if you don't have a UK character then you will have to pay the rent in one go. Like full rent in the first week of August. That, that is the case. But if you have a UK based guarantor Then you can make the payment in three or four installments. Yes.\nSpeaker B: And it doesn't matter if it's three or four and they have to be equally spaced, is that correct?\nSpeaker A: It's just that the guarantor should have a permanent residential address in uk. In any part of UK works. It's just that they.\nSpeaker B: No, no, I, I ask. Oh, any part of UK will work. So that's great. And I have more than one guarantor.\nSpeaker A: Okay, that's good.\nSpeaker B: Sorry, it's three or four. Meaning I asked about the installments. Three or four installments and they're equally spaced or how.\nSpeaker A: So basically either you can pay in full or three or four. So they are usually equally divided.\nSpeaker B: Okay, perfect. Yes. Well, that's it. I don't know if I have any more questions. I think that's very good. Yes.\nSpeaker A: Okay, just one. I'll take one more minute of yours. There is a security deposit that needs to be paid while booking the property.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: So like this is just the information that I'm giving, that this needs to be paid now. And then the rest of the rent installment will start from the first week of August. That's how it goes.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Yes. And how much is the security deposit? Sorry?\nSpeaker A: For this property it will be, I.\nSpeaker B: Guess, 250 GBP2 to 3100. Sorry, I can double check. I can check that. It's not a problem.\nSpeaker A: Okay, got it. So I'll just share this with you on WhatsApp and then we can continue the conversation from there. If you have any questions, let me know. And whenever you are ready to book it, whenever you decide on a room, just let me know there. So I'll ask the team to book it for you asap. Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay. I just wanted to let you know one more thing. That my WhatsApp number is not the same number as the one you have. Right.\nSpeaker A: Okay then please.\nSpeaker B: Should you write it if you want the WhatsApp number.\nSpeaker A: Yes, yes, yes. Please tell me. I'm writing it.\nSpeaker B: Okay. 447-552-5552.\nSpeaker A: Yes.\nSpeaker B: 222-260-0666.\nSpeaker A: I'll just repeat it. Okay, so it's double 47552, double 2 6066. Is that correct? Yes. Perfect. Okay, so I'll just share this with you.\nSpeaker B: It's a 755755, double 226066. Is that correct? Yes, yes. Okay, great.\nSpeaker A: Okay, thank you so much.\nSpeaker B: Thank you.\nSpeaker A: Take care. Bye Bye.\nSpeaker B: Thank you.",
