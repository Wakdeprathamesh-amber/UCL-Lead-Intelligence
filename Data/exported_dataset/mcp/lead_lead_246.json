      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, hello, am I speaking with Javid here?\nSpeaker A: Yes, yes.\nSpeaker B: From University College Accommodation for you.\nSpeaker A: Hi, Risha. Hi. Hi.\nSpeaker B: How are you, Javid?\nSpeaker A: I'm doing good. How are you?\nSpeaker B: I'm also good man, thank you for asking. So, Javish, just wanted to confirm if your friends and you have decided anything with the options.\nSpeaker A: No, yeah, this. Right now I'm exploring other options because like I got three other people with me. So we are looking for four people, houses, like entire place. So like we are going to try to be a little bit cost efficient here and the options in this private house are a little bit above our budget. But right now we are kind of looking for something. But if we don't find anything, we'll probably go back to that option. Just let me know so that I.\nSpeaker B: Can check with other properties as well which will provide you a lesser price.\nSpeaker A: Okay, I'm sorry, just couldn't hear that. Yeah, so just to take your time.\nSpeaker B: Just let me know if you wish to proceed because I can ask the properties to provide you certain cash back along with a discount.\nSpeaker A: Okay, yeah, but like. Well, the, the issue is that the average property cost per week is around like 260. Right. But the, the house, when we rent an entire house comes down to 2. 2, 202, something like that. If, if, if you're able to find the studio houses, studio rooms around 20, 30, that would be fine for us.\nSpeaker B: So like are you comfortable in sharing the room with your friends? So if I, if I'll able to find a studio room, I can do that. That's not an issue. Are you comfortable?\nSpeaker A: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I guess we can share the bathroom. Yeah, it wouldn't be a problem. Yeah, of course I have to check with them as well. But also, also the, the place of house significantly matters for us because right now we are looking for a property near to Canary wharf area. Like 15 minutes walk to our university.\nSpeaker B: So like University is Canary Walk, is it?\nSpeaker A: Yes, yes. It is located in Canada. So if you could be able to find anything near to that, it shouldn't. It doesn't necessarily need to be in Canary Wharf. It can be near to Canada rough as well. This doesn't matter for us. But think is the, the, the thing is like the areas that we previously looked with you mostly located in Wembley area. Right. And the distance between Wembley area and this canary is a little bit longer for us.\nSpeaker B: So if you add transportation.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, yeah.\nSpeaker B: Your campus is Wembley.\nSpeaker A: That's fine.\nSpeaker B: Options. But now I go now, now I know, okay. That it is Canary work. I'LL share you all the options. Are you comfortable with, you know, sharing Are you comfortable with basically sharing the bed as well? You mean or so are you comfortable.\nSpeaker A: With sharing the bed?\nSpeaker B: Like suppose if there is a studio room. So in that case, in the studio room the bed needs to be shared with the other person. So are you comfortable with that? Well, your friend, your friend or you like all four of you need the different bed, separate bed.\nSpeaker A: It should mean that we are comfortable with sharing the bed. I wouldn't think we would be comfortable sharing the bed. I mean, to be honest, we have found the studio room just like I I explained to you. I just did. I just don't quite remember the whole name but it was exactly what I described. Like they inside their room there are two beds, right? The room was a studio room. So something like that would be considered. If you could find something like that at a locals, we would be able to consider that.\nSpeaker B: Okay, I'll check this and get back to you.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: And I will check this.\nSpeaker A: Okay, thank you.\nSpeaker B: Appreciate it.\nSpeaker A: Bye.",
