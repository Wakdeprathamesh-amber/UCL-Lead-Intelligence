      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hi.\nSpeaker B: Hi, am I speaking with Guillermo Silva? Yeah, hi Silva, this is Chidushri from Amber student. How are you?\nSpeaker A: I'm good, how are you?\nSpeaker B: I'm doing all right, thanks for asking. I did receive your inquiry for chapter Kings Cross, London. Yeah, yeah. So like could you please help me understand your requirements? Like any specific reason why you shortlisted this property or like are you just like exploring the options?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, right now I'm just exploring my options.\nSpeaker B: Okay, so could you please give me a brief idea about like what kind of accommodations are you exactly looking for?\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I'm using students starting in September for a single year. Looking for studios mostly in a central area close to UCL.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Close to UCL London. And what is your preferred budget?\nSpeaker A: And around 500 quid a week would be ideal.\nSpeaker B: Okay. And like are you, will you be staying alone or you have some a co occupant staying with you?\nSpeaker A: I'll be staying alone.\nSpeaker B: Okay. Okay. Are you a home student like or an international student?\nSpeaker A: International student.\nSpeaker B: International. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So what I'll do is we can discuss the options now. Okay. There is this Chapter Kings Cross is a great option. Okay.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: Other than that there are like There is also £450 cash back currently applicable on this particular option. Other than that there are like a few other accommodations. Like you want something within walkable distance I believe.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, that's the idea.\nSpeaker B: Okay, just let me do a quick search. UCL School of Management. Right.\nSpeaker A: The UCO University College London. Not the School of Management, it's political science but it's just a Bloomsbury location.\nSpeaker B: Got it. Just a second. Any other preferences that you want me to keep in mind while suggesting you the option?\nSpeaker A: No, honestly, just like budget conscious on the lower side. Better. And ideally a studio, you know, unsuite small kitchen up.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, yeah. This like a self contained kitchen.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Dining area if possible.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: So just a second, I'm trying to sort the filter the ones which are nearest. Just a second.\nSpeaker A: Great.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. So there's John Dockson House London which is one of the nearest options available. And there's also IQ Bloomsbury London, that's also like great option. They have a silver studio but it is a bit like towards the budget is a bit higher. It's somewhere around 600 so that's not something which is within your budget. You can go for the premium studio or the club studio. Okay. Which is available at 559 pounds per week at Hugo Depot Point. It is around 20 minutes walking distance. Okay. If you can stretch your budget up to 550. Otherwise, if you want to keep it within 500, let me check. In that case, Chapters Kings first is the best. Like the nearest option. Okay. Which has a cinema, laundry facilities available and they also have a £450 cashback which I mentioned.\nSpeaker A: Oh yeah, the £450 back I saw. Which would be very helpful actually.\nSpeaker B: Yeah.\nSpeaker A: Okay. If any chance you could forward this via email through the platform so I can look at the options carefully with my family a bit?\nSpeaker B: Yeah, sure. This is your WhatsApp number, I believe.\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay. I have already texted you on WhatsApp. What I'll do is I'll share these options again. You can check and you can get back to me.\nSpeaker A: Okay, great, great, great, great. Actually, my WhatsApp might be linked to my old phone number, but I'm not really sure. So if you do have email, that's best. Otherwise no problem.\nSpeaker B: If I am unable to find you on WhatsApp, I will email you.\nSpeaker A: Okay, great. Thank you so much. Okay, I'll be in touch. Appreciate it. I'll make sure to talk about it with my family and Ladina. Thank you.\nSpeaker B: Sure, no worries. Take care. Have a great day ahead. Bye. Bye.\nSpeaker A: Bye.",
