      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello? Hello? Yes. Yeah, I. I just received a call from this number, so I thought I would. Is it. Is it Omesha that I'm speaking with? Yes, yes, yes, of the site calling you from abba. Student. Right. Omission. Just wanted to confirm. I can see that you're looking to book a student accommodation in London. Am I correct? Yeah. So have you seen the properties? I can see that you have seen Static Wasteland, House and one of the one more property. Correct. Yeah. So just wanted to confirm if you have shortlisted anything or like you will be needing more options. I think I will be needing more options. I mean, I really like the Dawn Greta House, but I'm still looking if I can find something under the budget. What's the budget that you have in your mind and the university name? Hello, Am I audible? Yes, yes, you are. I'm just speaking like, what kind of budget that you'll be looking for? Something around £250 per week. 250. And what's the university that you'll be going for? Bartlet, but it will be the E campus. Which university is it? Bartlett. Ucl. Bartlett. Okay. Ucl. University of London. And what kind of room preference that you have in your mind? I mean, I'm okay. I like, I would need a private bedroom, but I'm okay to share everything else. Kitchen, bathroom, whatever. So in that case, aesthetic ways will be a perfect fit for you because the request is well within the budget of yours. And along with that, you'll be able to see that it's a private room, the washroom and the kitchen or is on sharing basis in Sarah quiz. So according to my opinion, it can be a good property. Meanwhile, I'll do one thing here. I'll share you some more options regarding the sense and get back to you. Okay, sure. Yeah. Which one did you mention just now? Sarique Slen House. I will share it to you on your WhatsApp straight away for this property. All right? Yeah. Okay. Yes, sir, I think I have different number for my WhatsApp. I'm not sure if you have it. Can you please repeat that? I didn't get that part. I said I have a different number for my WhatsApp. Can I just give that to you? Yeah, please. So, like, I. I can see this number is also available on WhatsApp. So. So, like, I just registered it just for the sake of Amber. But I. I mean, this is not my WhatsApp number. Can I. Is that okay? Please type it in the WhatsApp chat and then I'll be able to text you, proceed forward. Okay. Sure. Okay. Okay. If. If I have any queries, I. I will talk to you on that number. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Done. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.",

      "transcript_text": "Speaker A: Hello.\nSpeaker B: Yeah, tell me.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, so actually I had just been calculating some commute costs and everything.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I mean I, I think that's not the best property for me because it's like it takes really long to commute and also with the cost it doesn't work out that great.\nSpeaker B: So what kind of course that you'll be looking forward to?\nSpeaker A: Actually I see this place called I think Raheel Court.\nSpeaker B: Rahel. Yeah, it's R A H E L.\nSpeaker A: Is it R A H E R.\nSpeaker B: E. Oh, let me check. Okay, okay. This top day is good. Let me check. It's £345 per week.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, but I mean if I'm like. I would like the option to you know, be able to walk back from the campus because like 1 hour 14 minutes would be too much. This is still like a little closer.\nSpeaker B: You're going for mile and campus. Is it Sorry, which campus that you'll be going for?\nSpeaker A: It's UCL Year east.\nSpeaker B: Ucl.\nSpeaker A: Yeah but it's not the one like it's not the main campus.\nSpeaker B: Is it? University of Cubria London campus. Which one is it?\nSpeaker A: Can you see. Hold on.\nSpeaker B: I can get this process like.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, can you see the hack name Marshall Center.\nSpeaker B: Just a minute, is it a property name that you are telling me?\nSpeaker A: No, no, no, it's, it's, it's like a green area. Yeah, Hackney Marshes.\nSpeaker B: Let me check.\nSpeaker A: Should I just send you the location on.\nSpeaker B: I'm able to see that. The Hackney location. I'm able to see that. I'm just checking you know the availability around that area. Let me check.\nSpeaker A: Like I'm just sending you the campus location just in case you need it.\nSpeaker B: So hackney, london londones would be.\nSpeaker A: Yeah, I've sent it to you.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. Can you please type it to your full university name so that I can check UCL at theories. Okay, so this is the university name, UCLA here is it?\nSpeaker A: Yeah.\nSpeaker B: So I'll do one thing here. I'll. I'll basically ask for property asked our team members. What about if I find your property like for three, four months in the initial phase but a bit, the cost can, can be a bit high but only for 34 months and it will be near to the University of Europe will that works for you rather than 51 weeks and later on if you wish to extend it, you can, that's not an issue.\nSpeaker A: Okay, how much would it be then?\nSpeaker B: Like I will share you the option very soon. I will, I will tell them to keep the budget as low as possible but for now I'm just. I'll do one thing here. I'll ask them for a quotation of the whole academic year and I'll. I'll check, like, how much that they can offer.\nSpeaker A: Yeah. And just one more thing. I could see one more property, like, it's sold out, but can you just ask them, like, when is the next room available? It's.\nSpeaker B: If it's sold out, then. Then there is a high chance it would be. Which property is it, though?\nSpeaker A: Stratford One. I'm just putting it in our chat. I think you should be able to see it.\nSpeaker B: Stratford one, london. I don't think it will be available anytime soon.\nSpeaker A: Okay, that's fine.\nSpeaker B: I'll do one thing. I'll have. I've asked the team to get this checked and then they'll get back to me.\nSpeaker A: Okay.\nSpeaker B: Okay.\nSpeaker A: Sure. Yeah. All right.\nSpeaker B: We.\nSpeaker A: We still have the Don Draton one, right?\nSpeaker B: Yes, we do have that.\nSpeaker A: Okay. All right. Thank you. Yeah.\nSpeaker B: Okay.",
